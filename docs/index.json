	"content": " Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer COSMIC (Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer) is a data resource that is designed to store and display somatic mutation information and related details and contains information relating to human cancers. Data in COSMIC is curated from known Cancer Genes Literature and Systematic Screens. COSMIC data is freely downloadable in many formats on the project\u0026rsquo;s FTP site: ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/CGP/cosmic.\nIf you use COSMIC annotations, please credit the project with the following acknowledgement:\nThe mutation data was obtained from the Sanger Institute Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer web site, http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic. Bamford et al (2004). The COSMIC (Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer) database and website. Br J Cancer, 91,355-358.\nThere are 3 data sources that you can use to annotate vtools project variants with those from the COSMIC project. There are 2 higher-level databases that annotate variants with information such as how many cancer samples have been documented to contain the variant. These databases include a database that annotates coding mutations (CosmicCodingMuts) and a database that annotates noncoding variants (CosmicNonCodingVariants).\nThere is also a more detailed database (CosmicMutantExport) that can be linked to these higher-level databases (e.g., vtools use CosmicMutantExport --linkedby CosmicCodingMuts.COSMIC_ID or vtools use CosmicMutantExport --linked_by CosmicNonCodingVariants.COSMIC_ID) to extract detailed information about the COSMIC variant (such as variant details and details of the samples the variant was detected in). See below for the available annotation fields from these databases.\n% vtools use CosmicCodingMuts % vtools show annotation CosmicCodingMuts -v2 Annotation database CosmicCodingMuts (version v61_260912) Description: Cosmic coding mutation database.

	"content": " Collapsing Methods for Disease and Quantitative Traits Introduction This is implementation of the fixed threshold collapsing methods for both disease and quantitative traits. Collapsing method for rare variants treats a genetic region as a test unit; based on observed genotype it assigns a numeric coding to the region {$X$}:{$$X = I_(0,N)(\\sum_i^N X_i)$$} i.e., the observed genotype will be coded as {$1$} if there exists at least one mutation, and {$0$} otherwise. This coding theme has been used in Li and Leal 2008[^Bingshan Li and Suzanne M. Leal (2008) Methods for Detecting Associations with Rare Variants for Common Diseases: Application to Analysis of Sequence Data. The American Journal of Human Genetics doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2008.06.024. http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0002929708004084^] and Bhatia et al 2010[^Gaurav Bhatia, Vikas Bansal, Olivier Harismendy, Nicholas J. Schork, Eric J. Topol, Kelly Frazer and Vineet Bafna (2010) A Covering Method for Detecting Genetic Associations between Rare Variants and Common Phenotypes. PLoS Computational Biology doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000954. http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000954^].\nAdvantages in using collapsing methods instead of aggregation methods? is in its robustness to LD of multiple rare variants in the region under investigation, which would potentially inflate type I error. However under additive assumptions of genetic effects, collapsing methods may be less powerful than aggregation methods.\nOur program implements the collapsing coding in a logistic regression framework for disease traits analysis (case control data) as CollapseBt method, and a linear regression framework for quantitative traits analysis as CollapseQt method. {$p$} value for collapsing method is based on asymptotic normal distribution of the Wald statistic in generalized linear models. One could incorporate a number of phenotype covariates in collapsing tests and evaluate the significance of the genetics component.\nAdjust for missing genotypes If the pattern of missing genotypes is not random in sample (e.g., missing ratio in cases is different from in controls), then type I error can be inflated. For small proportion of missing data, this issue can be alleviated using methods proposed by Auer et al 2013[^personal communication with Paul L. Auer at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center^], which is implemented as an option --NA_adjust.\nDetails Command interface % vtools show test CollapseBt Name: CollapseBt Description: Collapsing method for disease traits, Li \u0026amp; Leal 2008 usage: vtools associate --method CollapseBt [-h] [--name NAME] [--mafupper MAFUPPER] [--alternative TAILED] [--NA_adjust] [--moi {additive,dominant,recessive}] Fixed threshold collapsing method for disease traits (Li \u0026amp; Leal 2008). p-value is based on the significance level of the regression coefficient for genotypes.

	"content": " Fisher\u0026rsquo;s Exact Test for Single Variant Analysis Introduction Genetic association studies of common variants in case control samples usually compare directly the differences in frequencies of an allele or genotype between case and control populations, with the assumption that a significant difference in frequencies is indication to association between the locus and increase risk of disease. Many statistical tests for binomial or multinomial proportions can be used for such analysis, including Fisher\u0026rsquo;s exact test, {$\\chi^2$} test and Cochran-Armitage Trend Test. For rare variants association tests, single variant analysis will be underpowered (see Sahai H. 1996[^H. Sahai and A. Khurshid (1996) Formulas and tables for the determination of sample sizes and power in clinical trials for testing differences in proportions for the matched pair design: a review. Fundamental \u0026amp; Clinical Pharmacology doi:10.1111/j.1472-8206.1996.tb00614.x. http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1472-8206.1996.tb00614.x^] for power and sample size estimation for tests for proportions). Still single variant tests can be useful when only summary statistics is avaiable for controls (e.g., only MAF is available from public database), or one wants to compare the differences in frequency between populations for other purposes. For single variants analysis we offer the Fisher\u0026rsquo;s exact test routine which is abit conservative but guarantees type I error control for small sample sizes. Fisher\u0026rsquo;s test method in VAT is implemented as a special function for vtools update command, which is very efficient.\nFor Single variant tests adjusting for covariates, or tests for quantitative phenotypes, please refer to the multivariate methods? in VAT.\nUsage The function Fisher_exact(num_var_alleles_case, num_var_alleles_ctrl, 2*num_gt_case, 2*num_gt_ctrl) tests for association of an alternate allele with a phenotype (i.e., case or control) status. Given a variant site to be tested, the function takes in the following 4 parameters, that are obtainable through vtools functions:\n num_var_alleles_case: number of alternative alleles for the case samples num_var_alleles_ctrl: number of alternative alleles for the control samples num_gt_case: total number of genotypes for the case samples num_gt_ctrl: total number of genotypes for the control samples   Examples: Fisher\u0026rsquo;s exact test for case/ctrl association First, we compute statistics separately in cases and ctrls:\nvtools update variant --from_stat 'num_gt_case=#(GT)' 'num_var_alleles_case=#(alt)' --samples \u0026quot;filename in ('V1.vcf', 'V2.vcf')\u0026quot; Counting variants: 100% [================================] 2 69.2/s in 00:00:00 INFO: Adding field num_var_alleles_case INFO: Adding field num_gt_case Updating variant: 100% [==============================] 1,341 41.9K/s in 00:00:00 INFO: 1340 records are updated vtools update variant --from_stat \u0026quot;num_gt_ctrl=#(GT)\u0026quot; \u0026quot;num_var_alleles_ctrl=#(alt)\u0026quot; --samples \u0026quot;filename = 'V3.vcf'\u0026quot; Counting variants: 100% [===============================] 1 220.3/s in 00:00:00 INFO: Adding field num_var_alleles_ctrl INFO: Adding field num_gt_ctrl Updating variant: 100% [=============================] 988 42.7K/s in 00:00:00 INFO: 987 records are updated  And calcualte p-value for the Fisher\u0026rsquo;s exact test:\nvtools update variant --set \u0026quot;prop_pval=Fisher_exact(num_var_alleles_case, num_var_alleles_ctrl, 2*num_gt_case, 2*num_gt_ctrl)\u0026quot; INFO: Adding field prop_pva  [^#^]\n"

	"content": " Basic Statistics for Association Testing Units Introduction GroupStat and GroupWrite are \u0026ldquo;ancillary\u0026rdquo; features for the collection of VAT association tests. Instead of carrying out association analysis, GroupStat reports summary statistics of an association test unit such as total allele counts, total variant counts, number of samples, etc., while GroupWrite output genotype and phenotype information (into zipped bundles) in the format compatible with the SCORE-Seq software such that the data can be closely examined or manipulated using other software tools.\nAlthough the vtools export function may also write variant/genotype data into VCF and other formats with variants annotated and genotype calls cleaned after quality control, it will not be able to output result from fine-scale QC for each test unit (see the usage of? --discard_samples and --discard_variants). The GroupWrite will output the exact dataset that goes into association testing methods\nIt is recommended to run GroupStat and GroupWrite simultaneously with other association methods, as documented here?.\nDetails Command interface vtools show test GroupStat vtools show test GroupWrite Name: GroupWrite Description: Write data to disk for each testing group usage: vtools associate --method GroupWrite [-h] [--name NAME] directory Group data writer. It will create 3 files for each group: a phenotype file with rows representing samples , the 1st column is sample name, the 2nd column is the quantitative or binary phenotype and remaining columns are covariates if there are any; a genotype file with rows representing variants and the columns represent sample genotypes (order of the rows matches the genotype file). Coding of genotypes are minor allele counts (0/1/2). Missing values are denoted as NA; a mapping file that matches the group ID and variant ID in pairs. positional arguments: directory Output data will be written to the directory specified. optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit --name NAME Name of the test that will be appended to names of output fields.

The subprojects must have the same primary and alternative reference genome. Variant tables with the same names from multiple samples will be merged. Samples from the children projects will be copied even if they were identical samples imported from the same source files.  2. Details Command vtools init creates a new project in the current directory. The project will be empty unless it is a child project from a parent project (with a subset of samples, variants etc), or a parent project of several children projects (with merged variants and samples).\nA directory can only have one project. After a project is created, subsequent vtools calls will automatically load the project in the current directory. Working from outside of a project directory is not allowed.\nA variant tools project $name consists of a project file $name.proj, a genotype database $name_genotype.DB, and a log file $name.log. In addition to the project databases under the project directory, variant tools will store\n annotation databases, format specification etc in a local resource directory, which is by default ~/.variant_tools. You can use command \u0026ldquo;vtools admin --set_runtime_option local_resource\u0026rdquo; to relocate this directory if your home directory does not have enough free space. temporary files stored in a system temporary directory, which is usually under /tmp. If your temp partition is not large enough, you can set runtime option temp_dir to another directory. This directory will be cleared automatically after a project is closed, so do not point it to a directory with existing files.  2.1 Create a new project Command `vtools init NAME creates a new project NAME under the current directory. It will fail if there is already a project in the current directory, unless option --force is used to remove any existing project.\n Examples: create a new project The following commands create a directory myproj and create a variant tools project in this directory:\n% mkdir myproj % cd myproj % vtools init myproj INFO: variant tools 3.0.0dev : Copyright (c) 2011 - 2016 Bo Peng INFO: Please visit http://varianttools.sourceforge.net for more information. INFO: Creating a new project myproj  If you attempt to create another project in the same directory, command `vtools init will fail with an error message:\n% vtools init myproj ERROR: A project can only be created in a directory without another project.  Using the --force option will remove the existing project and create a new one:\n% vtools init test --force INFO: variant tools 3.0.0dev : Copyright (c) 2011 - 2016 Bo Peng INFO: Please visit http://varianttools.sourceforge.net for more information. INFO: Creating a new project test  \nIf you are worried about losing your work by accidentally calling vtools init with option --force, you could save copies of your project using command `vtools admin --save_snapshot from time to time, and load a saved snapshot using command `vtools admin --load_snapshot when needed.\n 2.2 Create a project from a parent project A project could be created from a parent project with a subset of its variants and samples. For example, a child project with variants from a small chromosomal region could be created from a parent project to test a pipeline before it is applied to the whole project. This also allows differential analysis of subsets of variants (e.g. SNVs and indels) and samples.\nThe following filters could be applied to the parent project\n --variants Only variants from the specified variant table of the parent project will be copied. Genotypes of samples will be affected because only genotypes related to these variants will be copied. --samples Only samples matching specified conditions (e.g. sample names) will be copied. --genotypes Only genotypes matching specified conditions (e.g. with quality score above certain threshold) will be copied.

For example, command\n% mkdir ../test % cd ..test % vtools init test --parent vt_simple INFO: variant tools 3.0.0dev : Copyright (c) 2011 - 2016 Bo Peng INFO: Please visit http://varianttools.sourceforge.net for more information.

In addition, if you have a snapshot file, you can use command\n% vtools init test --parent my_snapshot.tar.gz  which is a shortcut to commands\n% vtools init test % vtools admin --load_snapshot my_snapshot.tar.gz  2.3 Create a project from several subprojects A project could also be created from one or more children projects. This allows flexible handling of batches of data (e.g. analyze data separately or jointly), and parallel processing of large datasets (e.g. split a project by chromosomes, analyze them separately, and combine the results).\nMerging two or more variant tools projects will merge variants and samples from these projects. More specifically,\n variant tables with the same names are merged with duplicate variants removed variant info fields are merged. Projects that do not have certain fields will have NULL values for these fields. samples from the children projects are copied to the merged project even if they are identical.  Because subprojects might have overlapping variants, variant tables, and samples, merging subproject might lead to unexpected results.\nVariant tables from children projects will be copied to $name (from $proj) before they are merged. This allows you to keep track of information from the original projects, or compare tables from children projects.\n  Examples: merge subprojects Continue from the previous example, if we just merge the CEU and JPT projects we created,\n% mkdir ../merged % cd ../merged % vtools init merged --children ../CEU ../JPT INFO: variant tools 3.0.0dev : Copyright (c) 2011 - 2016 Bo Peng INFO: Please visit http://varianttools.sourceforge.net for more information.

If you have to merge samples with the same names from different projects, it is recommended that you use command vtools admin --rename_samples to change names of samples before merging, and remove duplicated samples afterwards.\nIf you have a large number of samples from different sources, it is a good idea to create subprojects for groups of samples. Merging subprojects will be faster than reading from source files again. However, due to the overhead of re-mapping all variants, pre-processing each sample by creating its own project usually does not help much.\n\nThe children projects can also be snapshots, so if you have snapshots of a number of children projects, you can create a merged project using command\n% vtools init test --children max_gt_data.tar poly_data.tar  The snapshots can also be an online snapshot so you can use an online snapshot to start your new project:\n% vtools init test --children vt_simple  "

	"content": " 1.Installing variant tools Variant Tools / Variant Association Tools is available on Mac OSX, and posix systems such as Linux, Unix and Solaris. It is distributed under a GNU Public License (V3), which means that you are free to use, change, and share this software. Due to the nature of next-gen sequencing data, a reasonably powerful machine is needed to use this tool for real-world applications.\n1.1 Compile from source if you have a standard Python installation If you have a standard Python installation (Python 2.7.1 or Python 3.3 or higher), you can install variant tools using command pip\n% pip install variant_tools  If you already have variant tools installed and would like to update to the newest version, run\n% pip install variant_tools --upgrade  to download and compile variant tools from source.\n1.2 Direct installation for Anaconda Python If you are using anaconda python, you can install Variant Tools using command\n% conda install -c https://conda.binstar.org/bpeng variant_tools  If you already have variant tools installed, running\n% conda update -c https://conda.binstar.org/bpeng variant_tools  would update variant tools to the newest version.\n1.3 Download and compile from source code (for advanced users) If no binary distribution is available for your platform or if you would like to perform a site-wide installation (see next section), you can build variant tools from source.\nPrerequisites:  Python  Variant Tools requires Python 2.7.1 or higher, or Python 3.2 or higher. Please make sure you have the right version of python before you install Variant Tools.  Mac OSX  Mac OSX Lion (10.7) comes with Python 2.7.1, which is compatible with Variant Tools. You can also download and install Python 3 from the Python website.  Linux  The latest version of Ubuntu has recent versions of Python 2 and Python 3. Redhat Linux comes with Python 2.6. You will have to upgrade it to Python 2.7, or install Python 3. Because header files are sometimes provided as separate packages, you will need to install packages such as python-dev or python3-dev (Ubuntu) if you see error messages related to missing header files. For example, Ubuntu and other debian-derived systems need to install packages python-dev, swig (if using development version), build-essential, and libbz2-dev.\n simuPOP (version 1.1.4 or higher) for the use of Variant Simulation Tools  You will need to install a recent version (1.1.4 or higher) of simuPOP if you plan to use Variant Simulation Tools to simulate data (command vtools simulate).\n A C/C++ compiler #   Linux (gcc)  Gcc is generally available for all Linux systems #MaxOS X (gcc or clang)\nFor MacOSX Lion (10.7), please install the latest version of Xcode, and Command Line Tools for Xcode if you are using Xcode 4.3.2 or later. If you wish to create Installer packages with PackageMaker, you will also need to install PackageMaker, which is in the “Auxiliary Tools for Xcode” package as of Xcode 4.3. The download page for this package can be opened via the Xcode -\u0026gt; Open Developer Tool -\u0026gt; More Developer Tools\u0026hellip; menu item. After downloading and mounting the disk image, drag the PackageMaker application to your /Applications directory.\nInstalling variant tools After downloading the variant tools package, please run\n% tar -xvzf variant_tools-VERSION.tar.gz % cd variant_tools-VERSION % (optionally, adjust site-wide options in source/site_options.py, see next section) % sudo python setup.py install  or\nsudo python3 setup.py install  if you would like to use Python 3.\nIf you get error messages for missing header files, please check if you have zlib and bzip2 library and header files installed. You might need to install packages such as bzip2-devel and zlib-devel under linux.\n Commands vtools and vtools_report in the source code directory will not work. Please move out of the installation directory and execute globally installed commands.\n 1.4 Installing variant tools locally variant tools consists of commands vtools and vtools_report, which are usually installed to /usr/local/bin. If you would like to install variant tools to a local directory, please use commands such as\n% python setup.py install --install-platlib=~/python_lib \\ --install-scripts=~/bin  In this way, the variant tools library will be installed to ~/python_lib, and the vtools and vtools_report commands will be installed to ~/bin. You will need to add ~/bin to $PATH, and set environment variables PYTHONPATH to refer to ~/python_lib so that python can find the library. If you are using bash, you can set these paths by adding the following two lines at the end of your .bashrc file:\n% export PATH=~/bin:$PATH % export PYTHONPATH=~/python_lib  1.5 Building the development version of variant tools If you would like to try the absolute newest version of variant tools, you can check out variant tools from its sourceforge git repository. Under linux, you can simply run\n% git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/varianttools/git varianttools % cd varianttools % python setup.py install # or python3 setup.py install  If you have changed the C/C++ code, you will need to re-generate the Python wrapper using SWIG. If you are using the latest version of Ubuntu, you can get it from package swig2.0. The package SWIG under Redhat or CentOS at version 1.34 is also usable (but only for python 2).\nDue to a bug in type handling, some versions of swig (2.0.6 and 2.0.7 are confirmed) can not be used to build variant tools. Please use version 2.0.4 if you experience any swig related problem.\n 1.6 Troubleshooting 1. Error message ImportError: No module named variant_tools.\nIf you used a customized local installation by setting --install-platlib, you will have to set PYTHONPATH to the specified directory (which should contain directory variant_tools). This can be done in the .bashrc file, or in a module file if a module management system is used.\n2. Error message Failed to import module (No module named _vt_sqlite3)\nWe have noticed this problem under some special circumstances. The problem is caused by lacking read permission of .so files under /path/to/site_package/variant_tools. Using chmod o+x /path/to/site_package/variant_tools/*.so can fix the problem.\n3. Use of clang compiler under MacOSX\nIf you are using a version of Python downloaded from the Python official website, you might need to create a symbolic link of gcc as gcc-4.2 using command\n% ln -s /usr/bin/gcc /usr/bin/gcc-4.2  because these distributions are built using command \u0026ldquo;gcc-4.2\u0026rdquo;. If you do not have gcc installed, clang could be used for variant tools version 1.0.3d or later.\n4. MaxOS X MDK mismatch with non-system Python\nThe downloaded version of Python might not use the same version of Xcode and OS SDK that is available on your system. For example, the official package for Python 3.2.3 assumes a SDK path of /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk, and will not work for Xcode 4.3.3 on OSX 10.7 with a SDK path of /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.7.sdk. To correct this problem, you will need to set CFLAGS explicitly, namely running\nexport CFLAGS=-sysroot,/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.7.sdk export LDFLAGS=-L/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.7.sdk/usr/lib  before you call python3 setup.py install to compile variant tools. Also, in this particular configuration, the vtools and vtools_report executables will be put under /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.2/bin instead of /usr/local/bin. You will either need to add /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.2/bin to $PATH, or create symbolic links of those executables to /usr/local/bin.\n2. Resource management for individual or site-wide installation 2.1 Batch download of resources The variant tools website hosts a large number of annotation databases and other resources. These files are downloaded automatically to a local resource directory (~/.variant_tools) when they are needed, and need not to be downloaded again. However, if you plan to use many of the variant tools resources and have enough disk space, you can download all variant tools resources into your local resource directory using commands\n% vtools admin --update_resource  This command by default download all current resources (e.g. most recent versions of annotation databases for latest version of reference genome). You can however using option hg18 to download resources for hg18\n% vtools admin --update resource hg18  Multiple users could share the same local resource directory if you put these files under a directory that is writable by multiple users, and set runtime option local_resource to this directory using command \u0026ldquo;vtools admin --set_runtime_option local_resource=XXX\u0026rdquo;. For example, you could download all resources to directory /Data/vtools_resource using commands\n% vtools init temp % vtools admin --set_runtime_option local_resource=/Data/vtools_resource % vtools admin --update_resource all % vtools remove project  Note that the all option will download all versions of resources for all reference genomes and can take a lot of disk spaces (about 60G as of March 2013).\nYou can set shared_resource during the variant tools installation so that you do not have to set $local_resource for each project.\n 2.2 Runtime options for site-wide installation from source code If you are a system administrator, you can change the default values of runtime options such as shared_resource, temp_dir, and search_path before installing variant tools. These options are defined in source/site_options.py. You can change them before running python setup.py install, or modify them afterwards (under a directory named similar to /usr/lib/python/lib/python2.7/site-packages/variant_tools).\n temp_dir. Users will by default use /tmp for temporary files. However, due to the size of next-gen sequencing data, /tmp might not have enough space for these files. You can set this option to a directory with more disk space if /tmp is small.\n shared_resource. A directory for shared resource files. It can be configured as\n No shared resource (default). All users maintain their own resource directory ($local_resource, which is usually ~/.variant_tools).\n A read-only directory with a mirror of the variant tools repository, with .DB.gz files decompressed in the annoDB directory. This is important because otherwise each user will have to decompress the files in their local resource directory. The system admin can choose to remove outdated databases to reduce the use of disk space. This option requires regular update of the resources.\n A directory that is writable by all users. The resources will be downloaded to this directory by users, and shared by all users. This option is easier to implement and requires less maintenance. A system administrator can choose to mirror the variant tools repository and let the users to keep it up to date.\n  search_path. This option is a ;-separated list of URL that host the variant tools repository. It should only be changed if you have created a local mirror of the variant tools repository. Adding the URL before the default URL might provide better downloading performance for your users. Removing the default URL is possible but not recommended.\n  2.3 Mirroring the variant tools repository You can mirror the variant tools repository and provide it either to local users or all users of variant tools. For example, you can run\n% vtools admin --mirror_repository /path/to/mirror  to create a local copy of the repository, and either\n add /path/to/mirror or a URL to the mirror to search_path in source/site_options.py. Users will be able to download from this mirror with better performance, or set /path/to/mirror as shared_resource so that users can use them directly. You can set this directory as read-only so that users cannot change the content of this directory.  We always look for public mirrors for our repository. Your help would be highly appreciated if you could send us the URL so that we can make it a public mirror for all variant tools users.\n The vtools admin --mirror_repository command should be run regularly to keep the mirror updated. It is recommended that you set it up as a daily cron job. The variant tools repository is split into a main repository and an archive repository. You generally need only to mirror the main repository. The archive repository contains earlier versions of annotation databases that are kept for reproducibility reasons.  "

	"content": " Variant annotation using variant tools Annotation Functions of Variant tools Variant, info fields, and annotation fields Variants in a variant tools project are stored in a master variant table after they are imported? from external data files. Multiple variant info fields could be added to this table to describe these variant. These fields could be imported from a file? when variants are imported, or updated? from files after variants are imported, calculated from samples as sample statistics, or derived from other variant info or annotation fields. Variant info fields are part of a project and are usually project-specific.\nAnnotation fields are provided in annotation databases and are available to a project after they are linked to the project?. Conceptually, annotation databases add columns to the master variant table so that you can select variants? based on these fields, or output? variants with these annotation fields. A key difference between an variant info field and an annotation field is that variant info is unique for each variant whereas there can be multiple annotation values for a single variant. Note that annotation databases vary greatly in number of fields and coverage of variants and usually do not provide annotation for all variants.\nVariant tools commands use?, output?, and export? The annotation features of variant tools involve mostly commands vtools use, vtools output, and vtools export.\n Command vtools use creates, downloads, and links annotation databases to a project. It accepts the name of an annotation database and try to locate it locally (current directory, ~/.variant_tools), online (usually \u0026lt;a class='urllink' href='http://vtools.houstonbioinformatics.org/annoDB' rel='nofollow'\u0026gt;http://vtools.houstonbioinformatics.org/annoDB\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;), and build an annotation database from source files if no existing database could be found. When a database is linked to a project, all its annotation fields becomes available to the project.  Command vtools show fields lists all variant info and annotation fields of a project.\n Command vtools output outputs variants in a variant table along with their info fields and annotation fields. Conceptually speaking, the master variant table and all the variant info and annotation fields form a huge table with variants as rows and fields as columns. This command outputs subsets of variants and fields to the standard output. (As an advanced feature, this command can also outputs summary statistics of variants and fields).\n Command vtools export export variant in specific formats. This command is similar to vtools output but it exports variants and related fields in user-specified formats?.\n  We will demonstrate the use of these commands in the Tutorial?.\nAnnotation databases Variant tools supports four different types of annotation databases where each type of databases links to variants using a different method. An annotation database can support one or more reference genomes and it must match either the primary or the alternative reference genome of a project to be linked to the project, unless it is a field database that annotate another field such as gene name.\nVariant-based databases Variant-based annotation databases annotate specific variants. They contain annotation information for variants (chr, pos, ref, alt). For example, the dbNSFP? database lists, among about 20 annotation fields, reference and mutated amino acid, nonsynonymous-to-synonymous-rate ratio, SIFT, PolyPhen2, MutationTaster and other scores, allele frequencies in dbSNP and the 1000 genomes project. Variant tools currently provides the following variant-based annotation databases:\n Exome Variant Server (EVS)?: NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (ESP) variants with population-specific allele frequencies and various functional annotations (currently has two versions: evs was created from EVS on November 7, 2011 with approximately 2500 exomes; evs_5400 was created from EVS on December 15, 2011 with approximately 5400 exomes). dbNSFP?: non-synonymous variants of CCDS genes. dbSNP?: NCBI\u0026rsquo;s variant database. 1000 Genomes?: 1000 Genomes variants deposited in dbSNP. 1000 Genomes (provided through the European Bioinformatics Institute)?: This represents version 3 of an integrated variant call set based on both low coverage and exome whole genome sequence data from the 1000 Genomes project. Coding and NonCoding variants from the COSMIC (Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer) Project?  Position-based databases Position-based databases annotate chromosomal locations. Such databases provide annotation for all variants at a locus, mostly because there is no variant-specific information available. For example, the gwasCatalog? database contains chromosomal locations of susceptibility loci of all published genome wide association studies.\n gwasCatalog?: this annotation source can be used to annotate your variants with published GWA hits. The database is probably more useful as a range-based database however (see example of how to use this database as a range-based database here?).  Range-based databases Range-based databases annotate regions of chromosomes. These databases are used to annotate regions of chromosomes, such as genes, exon regions of genes, and highly-conserved regions. Variant tools provides the following range-based annotation databases:\n refGene?: specifies known human protein-coding and non-protein-coding genes taken from the NCBI RNA reference sequences collection (RefSeq). knownGene?: defines gene predictions based on data from RefSeq, Genbank, CCDS and UniProt. ccdsGene?: contains high-confidence gene annotations from the Consensus Coding Sequence (CCDS) project phastCons?: defines phastCons scores (e.g., conservation scores) for blocks of the human genome. cytoBand?: gives the approximate location of cytogenic bands as seen on Giemsa-stained chromosomes. gwasCatalog?: this annotation source can be used to find published GWA hits that are \u0026ldquo;near\u0026rdquo; your variants. To use the annotation source as a range-based database, you must specify a coordinate range that describes how close your variant needs to be to the GWA hit (see example?).  Field databases Field-based annotation databases annotate variants indirectly through other variant info or annotation fields. For example, the keggPathway? database lists all the pathways genes belong so it technically annotate gene IDs, not variants. To use this database, you will need to first link the project to a database that provides IDs of genes each variant belongs, and then link the keggPathway database to the project through gene ID. Therefore, a \u0026ndash;linked_by field is required to use a field-based database. Variant tools provides the following field-based annotation databases:\n keggPathway?: allows annotation of variants to KEGG pathways indirectly by using CCDS gene IDs. As a pre-requisite, first variants need to be annotated to CCDS gene IDs - if you use dbNSFP this is already done for you because dbNSFP annotates variants to CCDS gene IDs. CancerGeneCensus?: genes for which mutations have been causally implicated in cancer, maintained by Cancer Genome Project gwasCatalog?: in addition to being used as a position- or range-based annotation source, gwasCatalog can be used as a field-based annotation source to find published GWA hits that are in the same cytoband as your project variants. To use gwasCatalog as a field-based database, you can link your variants to the cytoBand? annotation source and then annotate your variant cytoBands to published GWA hits (see example?). Detailed annotation for each COSMIC (Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer) Mutant?  Create your own annotation databases If you would like to use an annotation database that is not provided by variant tools, you could write a customized .ann file to? create your own annotation database. This file tells variant tools the type of annotation database, reference genome, URL to source files, version, and more importantly, the type of each annotation field and how to extract them from source files. A large number of functors? are provided in case that you need to post-processing texts from input file to extract values of annotation fields.\nCitation for Variant Annotation Tools Please cite\nF.

	"content": " Variant Association Tools About Variant Association Tools (VAT), designed and developed by Gao Wang (Baylor College of Medicine), Dr. Bo Peng (the University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center) and Dr. Suzanne Leal (Baylor College of Medicine), is a new developmental branch of variant tools expanding its scope from analyzing individual genomic variants to analyzing large sequence data (whole genome sequencing, whole exome sequencing) or exome genotyping arrays (exome chips) from population based genotype-phenotype association studies. It features a large collection of utilities devoted to data exploration, quality control and association analysis of rare/common single nucleotide variants and indels.\nVariant Association Tools inherits the intuitive command-line interface of variant tools with re-design and implementation of its infrastructure to accommodate the scale of dataset generated from nowadays sequencing efforts on large populations. Features of Variant Association Tools are implemented into vtools subcommand system\n vtools update, vtools phenotype and vtools_report implements data management, exploration and quality control for association studies. Various summary statistics on variants, genotypes or samples can be obtained to learn characteristics of data, to create data cleaning filters, or to provide answers to scientific hypothesis. vtools associate implements a number of rare variant association tests for rare variants association analysis. We developed a VAT ensemble method that generalizes a number of burden tests for rare variants into a unified framework.  VAT association pipeline\nAttach:association_pipeline.png\nRegistration and download variant association tools is packaged into the variant tools system, and shares its mailing list. Please refer to the installation guide? for download and installation instructions.\nCitation Please cite\nGao Wang, Bo Peng and Suzanne M. Leal (2014) Variant Association Tools for Quality Control and Analysis of Large-Scale Sequence and Genotyping Array Data, The American Journal of Human Genetics 94 (5): 770–83.\nif you find Variant Association Tools helpful and use it in your publication. Thank you.\nData Exploration and Quality Control We demonstrate data exploration and QC in a few tutorials? available from this website. You may start with the intro tutorial and move on to advanced in preparation for your real world project. Please contact us if you think additional data exploration and QC steps should be included in the VAT QC pipeline.\nAssociation Tests Statistical tests for association are implemented under vtools associate, and can be categorized as\n Single gene rare variant tests, including CMC, BRV, KBAC, WSS, RBT, VT, aSum, RareCover, c-alpha, etc; Rare variants analysis conditional on arbitrary phenotype covariates for both disease and quantitative traits, including CollapsedTest, BurdenTest, VariableThresholdsTest, WeightedBurdenTest-WSS, WeightedBurdenTest-KBAC, WeightedBurdenTest-RBT; Two flexible regression methods allowing for combination of several internal weighting themes and any arbitrary external weights (e.g., functional information) as well as the variable thresholds framework; Association testing interface to external software, including the R package SKAT and the SCORE-Seq program; Ancillary routines reporting basic statistics for association test units (GroupStat) or exporting the association data from project database (GroupWrite).  The flexible regression framework naturally supports single SNV analysis (for common variants). It also provides analysis of imputed genotype data although some weighting themes may not apply. For data with missing genotypes (either due to genotype calling failure or QC cleaning) remedies are available for several burden tests based on Auer et al 2013[^personal communication with Paul L. Auer at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center^]. For implementation details of each method, please refer to this [documentation] on rare variants association methods.\nFine-scale Data Cleaning for Association Test Units Associate tests for rare variants are often carried out by units of groups, which is usually genes in the context of exome analysis. The distribution of missing genotype data in each group might be different, and as has been discussed in previous section it is recommended to perform fine-scale cleaning of missing data while running association analysis. This is implemented as options --discard_samples '%(NA)\u0026gt;p' and --discard_variants '%(NA)\u0026gt;p'. The first option will dynamically remove samples having more than a proportion of {$p$} missing genotypes within each association group; the second option will remove variant sites based on specified missingness criteria after the first option is applied.\nFor genes having too few variant sites after data cleaning, we can analyze them first yet keep a record of the actual number of variant sites that contributed to each association test unit (using GroupStat) and clean out the results for groups failing to satisfy some minimum variant sites cut-off.\nStoring and Representing Association Results Results from association analysis are available as commandline standard output which can be redirected to a file. It is also possible (and is strongly recommended) to record the results into an annotation database via --to_db option. Using a database to store the results will not only facilitate post-analysis variant selection/output conditioning on variant properties annotated by association analysis, but also make it possible to interrupt an association scan at any time and resume the analysis without having to start all over. Association results ({$p$} values) can be graphically viewed using AssociationViewer, a utility software that produces high quality QQ and Manhattan plots of {$p$} values.\n[^#^]\n"

	"content": " Single gene Association Tests for Single Gene and Case Control Phenotypes The application of next-generation sequencing methods to the discovery of disease causal genes has been successful in finding rare genetic mutations responsible for a number of Mendalian disorders. There is growing evidence that rare variants contribute to the etiology of complex traits and whole genome (or exome) squencing in large populations provides valuable resource for identifying such variants. Although it is believed that effect size of rare variants to complex diseases is usually higher compare to common variants, due to the low frequency of rare variants large sample size is required to detect the effect. To improve power a number of methods have been proposed which analyze groups of variants together as a single unit. These methods are generally viewed as first moment methods (collapsing methods such as CMC, RareCover; aggregation methods such as WSS, KBAC, RBT, etc.) and second moment methods (such as {$C(\\alpha)$} and SKAT).\nMost statistical methods for rare variants were originally proposed for association analysis between single gene and case control phenotype, although many can be readily generalized into testing for association adjusting for phenotype covariates. Implementation of single gene analysis in VAT include:\n CMC method? C{$(\\alpha)$} method? KBAC method? RBT method? RareCover method? VT method? WSS method? aSum method?  These single gene analysis methods are implemented in the form as they were originally published with minimal modifications or optimizations. They are good for analyzing gene and case control phenotype associations without adjusting for covariates. Please use multivariate methods? if you want to perform conditional association analysis (--covariates option). The multivariate methods generalizes the scope of rare variant association tests to being able to handle both quantitative and case control data with flexible weighting and grouping approaches.\n"

	"content": " Variant Simulation Tools A presentation about variant simulation tools (Sep. 2014)\nVariant Simulation Tools is still under development. Development (subversion) versions of Variant Tools and simuPOP are needed to use VST. Also, because of a lack of mature simulation models (only two examples in the submitted paper are available), users are strongly advised to contact me for the creation of any simulation model.\nWhat is Variant Simulation Tools Variant Simulation Tools (VST) is a simulation tool for post-GWAS genetic epidemiological studies using whole-genome or whole-exome next-gen sequencing data, with an emphasis on user-friendliness and reproducibility. Because simulating high-quality datasets for genetic epidemiological studies requires careful selection and validation of appropriate simulation method for particular applications, VST aims to provide validated application-specific simulation methods and simulated datasets. It distinguishes itself from other simulators in that\n VST provides multiple simulation engines for different simulation methods  Because different simulation methods have their own pros and cons and application areas, VST does not limit itself to a particular simulation method. Instead, it provides simulation engines for theoretical, forward-time, coalescent, and resampling-based simulations.\n VST separates simulation models from their implementations  VST uses a two-tier design. The core of VST is a set of functions to perform different tasks and is distributed with Variant Tools. Simulations are defined in simulation specification files that are stored in the variant tools repository. New simulations become available to all VST users as soon as they are uploaded to the repository.\n VST encourages reproducible simulations  Each VST simulation encapsulates simulation methods and parameters that have been used for a particular application. It allows no or only a few parameters to make it easy to reproduce a simulation. In addition to simulation models, VST also distribute simulated datasets for some simulation models, making it easier for casual users to explore the properties of selected simulation models.\nWhereas it is easy to reproduce an existing VST simulation, creating a new simulation? in VST requires some in-depth knowledge of simuPOP and variant tools. It is strongly recommended that you discuss your simulation study with other users of VST in the varianttools-user mailing list before you write your own simulations. You could also write to me directly if you would like to discuss your project in private.\nAttach:repository.jpg\nSchematic illustration of the role of the variant tools repository in the distribution of simulation models and simulated datasets. The repository provides simulation models and simulated datasets that can be downloaded using VST. Casual users can download simulated datasets and use them without running VST. Users who need to use a model without existing simulated datasets or need more replicates of an existing simulation can simulate data using VST. Advanced users who write their own simulation methods can choose to share their models with others by uploading their models to the repository.\nKey features  VST simulates real nucleotide sequences of the human genome  VST simulates human nucleotide sequences with common or rare mutations. Simulated variants (mutations) locate at specific locations of the genome (chr and pos) with reference (ref) and alternative alleles (alt). VST maps mutations to the human genome if the underlying simulation engine simulates SNP markers on hypothetical regions.\n The forward-time simulation engine knows the regions it simulate  In comparison to previous forward-time simulations that simulate hypothetical genomic regions with random fitness effect, VST * identifies all genes (isoforms) that locate within or overlap with the user-provided regions, locates exons, coding regions, and codons on the forward and reverse strands. * recombine parental chromosomes using a fine-scale genetic map with recombination rates and hotspots provided by the HapMap project * use a nucleotide mutation model to introduce new mutants to the population * determine the fitness of individuals from amino-acid changes of the translated protein sequences\n VST supports a large number of penetrance and quantitative trait models and sampling methods  The flexible design of VST allows the application of very complex penetrance and quantitative trait models to the simulated population and draw random, case control, extreme trait, and pedigree-based samples.\n Datasets simulated by VST could be exported in VCF format, or analyzed directly using Variant Association Tools  Simulated datasets could be exported and analyzed by other programs, or imported into a variant tools project and analyzed directly using Variant Association Tools?.\nBasic usages of VST Step 1: check available simulation models After installing variant tools?, run\n% vtools show simulations Peng2011_srv Re-implementation of some of the simulations performed by SRV (Peng \u0026amp; Liu, Simulating Sequences of the Human Genome with Rare Variants, 2011).

The simulated populations are analyzed and discarded to save diskspace. ... ...  to get a list of available simulation models.\nIf you cannot find a simulation model that fits your need, please write to the varianttools-user mailing list and check if others have performed similar simulations using VST. You could also write to me directly for potential collaboration on simulation part of your study.\nStep 2: Learn the details of a simulation model A simulation specification file can define multiple simulation models.

For each simulation, a file cache/MODEL_SEED.cfg will be created as the input file for the execution of the simulation pipeline. You can, however, use the --seed option to specify the seed of the simulation to reproduce a previous simulation.\nFor reproducibility reasons, all simulated datasets provided my VST will be simulated with seeds 1, 2, 3, \u0026hellip;.\nThe vtools simulate command by default only simulates one replicate of the simulation. It will repeat itself a number of times if option --replicates is specified. SEED, SEED+1, SEED+2 etc will be used as seed for subsequent simulations.\nIf you need to run multiple instances of VST at the same time, please use separate directories for different instances of the vtools simulate command.\nSpecification of regions (option --regions) Because VST simulates true genomic regions of the human genome, a key parameter of many simulation models is --regions. You can, for example, pass a region in chr:start-end format as\n--regions chr17:540000-570000  or multiple regions as\n--regions chr17:540000-570000,20000-210000,chr20:123450-134500  Here multiple regions are separated by \u0026ldquo;,\u0026rdquo;, and chromosome name can be ignored if it is the same as the previous region.\nMore interestingly, you can use value of a field-based annotation database to specify regions. For example,\n--regions refGene.name2:BRCA1  locates all genes (isoforms) in the refGene database with common name name2 equals to BRCA1. You can specify regions for multiple genes using\n--regions refGene.name2:BRCA1,BRCA2,P53  You can use a different annotation database for this purpose. For example\n% vtools simulate MODELFILE MODEL --regions refGene_exon.name2:BRCA1,BRCA2  simulates exon regions of BRCA1 and BRCA2. Command vtools use refGene_exon will be automatically called if refGene_exon is not linked to the current project.\nThe --regions option allows the use of set operations (|, \u0026amp;, -, and ^ for union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference, respectively) to modify specified regions. For example, if you need to specify intron regions of a gene, you can use\n--regions 'refGene.name2:BRCA1 - refGene_exon.name2:BRCA1'  Another example would be to limit, for example, a penetrance model to certain chromosome regions:\n--regions 'refGene.name2:BRCA1 \u0026amp; chr17:41196312-41200000'  "

You can add path to bwa and samtools to $PATH or pass full path name to options bwa=/path/to/bwa and samtools=/path/to/samtools. Paths to Picard and GATK should be passed using options gatk_path and picard_path.\nTest the environment After you installed the programs, you should running the following commands to test if everything works ok:\n% vtools init test --parent vt_illuminaTestData % vtools execute bwa_gatk_hg19 align --input illumina_test_seq.tar.gz --output test.bam \\ --gatk_path /path/to/gatk --picard_path /path/to/picard --strict_prog_version False  Executing the pipeline in production mode The pipeline will by default keep all intermediate files. If you restart the pipeline with different parameter or a different version of an external file, only the affected steps will be repeated. Intermediate files will be reused if available. This allows you to examine and fine-tune the pipeline to make sure it works as expected.\nBecause intermediate files can be large, an option --production true is provided to execute the pipeline in production mode. In this mode, most intermediate files will be removed after the completion of the steps that make use of them. The pipeline can resume from the right step if it is interrupted, but has to be re-executed from the beginning if a result file is removed.\n"

Working from outside of a project directory is not allowed.\n  Examples \nLet us create a sample project and import two datasets from the pilot phase of the 1000 genomes project:\n% vtools init concept % wget http://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/1000genomes/ftp/pilot_data/release/2010_07/exon/snps/CEU.exon.2010_03.sites.vcf.gz % wget http://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/1000genomes/ftp/pilot_data/release/2010_07/exon/snps/JPT.exon.2010_03.sites.vcf.gz % vtools import CEU.exon.2010_03.sites.vcf.gz --build hg18 --sample_name CEU --var_info AA AC AN DP % vtools import JPT.exon.2010_03.sites.vcf.gz --sample_name JPT --var_info AA AC AN DP  The project properties can be displayed as follows\n% vtools show project Project name: concept Primary reference genome: hg18 Secondary reference genome: None Runtime options: verbosity=1 Variant tables: variant Annotation databases:  \n{{% alert theme=\u0026ldquo;info\u0026rdquo; %}} Variant Tools can import and manage large projects with thousands of samples and millions of variants. Although it can be slow to import data from large whole genome sequencing projects (e.g. it takes around 3 days to import all genotype data from the 1000 genomes project, with raw data exceeding 1T in size), data analysis is relatively fast because imported data are properly organized (indexed) and readily accessible. {{%/alert%}}\nVariant \u0026amp; variant table Variants refer to DNA sequence variations at a particular locus. Each variant consists of a chromosome name (1, 2, \u0026hellip;, X etc, without leading chr), a position (1-based), a reference allele, and an alternative allele, denoted by fields chr, pos, ref, and alt. variant tools currently supports SNV, small indels, and MNP (Multiple-nucleotide polymorphism). All variants are assumed to be on the forward (+) strand.\nUnlike some other tools that can analyze variants in external files directly, variants must be imported into a project before they are annotated or analyzed. All variant tools project has a master variant table that consists of all variants in this project. These variants are usually imported? from external files. A project can have many variant tables that consist of subsets of variants from the master variant table. They are usually created using command vtools select according to sample properties and annotation of variants. Information about variant tables can be listed by command vtools show tables. Names of variant tables can contain special characters such as \u0026lsquo;@\u0026rsquo;.\n  Examples \nThis project has a single master variant table with 4,858 variants:\n% vtools show tables table #variants date message variant 4,858  Each variant has chr, position, reference and alternative alleles,\n% vtools output variant chr pos ref alt --limit 5 1 1105366 T C 1 1105411 G A 1 1108138 C T 1 1110240 T A 1 1110294 G A  We can select all variants with reference allele T and save the results to a variant table named refT,\n% vtools select variant 'ref=\u0026quot;T\u0026quot;' --to_table refT 'variants with reference allele T' Running: 2 314.2/s in 00:00:00 INFO: 787 variants selected.  Now there are two variant tables variant and refT in this project\n% vtools show tables table #variants date message variant 4,858 refT 787 Nov29 variants with reference allele T  As you can see, all variants in table refT have reference allele T:\n% vtools output refT chr pos ref alt --limit 5 1 1105366 T C 1 1110240 T A 1 3537996 T C 1 6447088 T C 1 6447275 T C  \nvariant info and variant info field variant info refers to information that describes a variant, such as the INFO fields of a vcf file. It usually consists of annotation information such as membership in dbSNP, or sample statistics such as sample frequency of each variant. The names of these info are called variant info fields and can be displayed using command vtools show fields.\nExamples: The project has 4 variant info fields AA, AC, AN, and DP, as shown by the following command\n% vtools show fields variant.chr variant.pos variant.ref variant.alt variant.AA variant.AC variant.AN variant.DP  These fields are imported from the INFO fields of the vcf file, and are the ancestral allele, total number of alternate alleles in called genotypes, total number of alleles in called genotypes, and Read Depth from MOSAIK BAM, respectively, for each variant. These fields could be outputted for each variant,\n% vtools output refT chr pos ref alt AA AC AN DP --limit 5 1 1105366 T C T 4 114 3251 1 1110240 T A T 1 178 7275 1 3537996 T C C 156 156 1753 1 6447088 T C T 12 172 4691 1 6447275 T C T 9 176 6871  More variant info fields could be added to the project using command vtools update.\n% vtools update variant --from_file CEU.exon.2010_03.sites.vcf.gz --var_info id vtools update variant --from_file CEU.exon.2010_03.sites.vcf.gz --var_info id INFO: Using primary reference genome hg18 of the project.

They are not part of a project but they provide additional annotation fields to a project when they are linked? to a project. Conceptually speaking, attaching annotation databases to a project adds info fields to variants of the project, although annotation databases usually annotate only part of the variants, leaving a lot of NULL values for these fields.\nExamples: Let us download and use an annotation database dbSNP version 130 for reference genome hg18\n% vtools use dbSNP-hg18_130 INFO: Downloading annotation database from http://vtools.houstonbioinformatics.org/annoDB/dbSNP-hg18_130.DB.gz INFO: Decompressing /Volumes/Home/.variant_tools/annoDB/dbSNP-hg18_130.DB.gz INFO: Using annotation DB dbSNP in project quickstart.

It provides another source of annotation to variant tools through function track(filename, field). variant tools currently support track files in tabix-indexed vcf, indexed BAM, bigBed, and bigWig formats.\nExamples: If we download a bigWig annotation file from the UCSC ENCODE website, you can use it to annotate and select variants,\n% vtools output variant chr pos ref alt 'track(\u0026quot;wgEncodeGisRnaSeqH1hescCellPapPlusRawRep1.bigWig\u0026quot;)' -l 10 1 1105366 T C 3.0 1 1105411 G A 2.0 1 1108138 C T . 1 1110240 T A . 1 1110294 G A . 1 3537996 T C . 1 3538692 G C . 1 3541597 C T . 1 3541652 G A 1.0 1 3545211 G A .  \nSample, genotype and genotype info A sample in variant tools refers to a collection of variants with optional associated genotypes, and genotype info fields. Here genotype refers to type of variants (homozygote, heterozygote or others) of a particular sample at a particular locus. If there is only one variant at a locus, a genotype can be `(all wildtype alleles),1(heterozygote), or2(homozygous alternative alleles). If there are more then one variants at a locus, a genotype can be-1`, referring to two different alternative alleles. variant tools currently does not consider phase of genotypes.\nEach genotype can have any number of genotype info fields, which are information that describes a genotype, usually quality scores of each called variant.\nSample names are important but not unique identifiers of samples. For example, genotypes belonging to the same physical sample might be imported from several files (e.g. chromosome by chromosome), resulting in several variant tools samples that share the same name. (In this case, you can use commands \u0026ldquo;vtools admin --merge_samples\u0026rdquo; to merge them into one sample). Samples are usually identified by an SQL query so you could use sample name, filenames from which samples are imported, and arbitrary phenotypes (e.g. affection status) to specify samples.\nNot all samples have genotypes because variant tools can treat a list of variants as a sample.\nExamples: This project has two samples with names CEU and JPT:\n% vtools show samples sample_name filename CEU CEU.exon...3.sites.vcf.gz JPT JPT.exon...3.sites.vcf.gz  However, for this particular project, the samples are just lists of variants so there is no genotype and genotype fields.\n% vtools show genotypes sample_name filename num_genotypes sample_genotype_fields CEU CEU.exon.2010_03.sites.vcf.gz 3489 JPT JPT.exon.2010_03.sites.vcf.gz 2900  \nPhenotype phenotypes in variant tools are generally any properties of samples, such as blood pressure, weight, height, ethnicity, affection status, ID, and ID of parents. It could be imported? from a text file, calculated from samples (e.g. average quality score of all variants of a sample could be a phenotype of the sample), or from other phenotypes. Phenotypes are frequently used to identify groups of samples (e.g. by affection status using parameter --samples 'aff=1'), and in genotype-phenotype association analysis.\nExamples: This project does not have any genotype and existing phenotype, we can add a phenotype num as the number of variants in each sample:\n% vtools phenotype --from_stat 'num=#(GT)' Calculating phenotype: 100% [==============================================================================] 2 2.0/s in 00:00:01 INFO: 2 values of 1 phenotypes (1 new, 0 existing) of 2 samples are updated.  The samples are now have a phenotype called num,\n% vtools show samples sample_name filename num CEU CEU.exon...3.sites.vcf.gz 3489 JPT JPT.exon...3.sites.vcf.gz 2900  \nPrimary and alternative reference genome Variant Tools supports build hg18 and hg19 of the human genome natively. For reference genome of other species, you will need to provide fasta sequences of the reference genome and use command vtools admin --fasta2crr to convert it to a binary format that can be used by variant tools.\nBecause the same variants might have different coordinates on different reference genomes, it is very important to know the build of the reference genome of your data, which can be hg18 or hg19 for the human genome. The build information is important because it tells variant tools what annotation databases should be used. If you are uncertain about the reference genome used for your data, you could use a recent build and command vtools admin --validate_build to check if you have specified the correct build.\nA sequencing analysis project might sometimes need to handle data using different reference genomes. For example, you might need to use a new batch of sample with variants called using a more recent reference genome, or some public control data that use an older reference genome. Variant tools allows you to important data in an alternative reference genome in addition to a primary reference genome that the project uses. Variant tools will automatically convert between different coordinates so you do not have to worry about matching variants across datasets.\n Please use name hg19 if your data uses b37, because the name hg19 is used for all annotation databases. Note that variant tools uses 1, 2 etc (for b37) instead of chr1, chr2 etc (for hg19) internally but it can handle data sources with chr1 etc.\n Whereas projects with a single reference genome will have unique coordinates for variants (chr, pos), projects with two reference genomes might have missing or duplicate coordinates for each reference genome. This is because not all genomic locations could be mapped from one reference genome to another and two locations might be mapped to the same location on another reference genome.\n  Examples: Our project uses reference genome hg18 so we used dbSNP version 130 because the latter versions of dbSNP make use of reference genome hg19. If you would like to use a newer version of dbSNP for this project, you can first add an alternative reference genome to the project by lifting over existing variants:\n% vtools liftover hg19 INFO: Downloading liftOver tool from UCSC INFO: Downloading liftOver chain file from UCSC INFO: Exporting variants in BED format Exporting variants: 100% [==========================================================================] 4,858 129.6K/s in 00:00:00 INFO: Running UCSC liftOver tool INFO: Reading liftover chains Mapping coordinates Updating table variant: 100% [=======================================================================] 4,858 32.6K/s in 00:00:00  The project now has two reference genomes\n% vtools show project Project name: quickstart Primary reference genome: hg18 Secondary reference genome: hg19 Database engine: sqlite3 Runtime options: verbosity=1 Variant tables: variant refT inDBSNP Annotation databases: /Volumes/Home/.variant_tools/annoDB/dbSNP (hg18_130)  Now if we remove and re-link to dbSNP, we can use version 135 of the database\n% vtools remove annotations dbSNP % vtools use dbSNP INFO: Removing annotation database dbSNP from the project INFO: Downloading annotation database from annoDB/dbSNP.ann INFO: Downloading annotation database from http://vtools.houstonbioinformatics.org/annoDB/dbSNP-hg19_135.DB.gz INFO: Using annotation DB dbSNP in project quickstart.

Pipelines are used, among many possibilities, to use external commands such as bwa and gatk to align raw reads and call genetic variants from aligned reads.\n"

This file will be automatically created and reused if it already exists. You will need to remove this file if you run the same pipeline using another region. (default: extracted.vcf)  Model As a demonstration of the simulation engines of VST, we simulated the evolution of a sequence of 63,000 base pairs on chromosome 17 (chr17:41,200,001-41,263,000) using four simulation methods: a neutral coalescent simulation using ms [Hudson 2002] (wrapped by VST), a neutral forward-time simulation, a simulation with natural selection, and a resampling-based simulation. This region overlaps with five isoforms (NM_007294, NM_007297, NM_007298, NM_007299, NM_007300) of BRCA1, with 5337 nucleotides (8.47%) within the coding regions of one of the isoforms. All coalescent and forward-time simulations assumed a demographic model that mimics the evolution of the European population. This model evolves an initial population of 8,100 individuals for 81,000 generations and expands it to 900,000 individuals in 370 generations after a short bottleneck of 7,900 individuals [Kryukov, et al. 2007]. A mutation rate of 1.8 × 10–8 was used for ms. A Jukes-Cantor DNA evolution model with mutation rate 2.4 × 10–8 was used for the forward-time simulations because the Jukes-Cantor model with mutation rate μ mutates a nucleotide to any of the four nucleotides at equal probability and has an effective mutation rate of 0.75 μ. For VST simulations with natural selection, we used constant fitness values 0.005, 0.02, and 0.1 for missense, stoploss, and stopgain mutations, respectively. A multiplicative model was used to combine fitness values if an individual carried more than one non-synonymous mutation. This model applies strong purifying selection to stopgain mutations and practically disallows the existence of such mutations in the population. The resampling-based simulation extracts genotypes at this region from the 1000 Genomes Project and expands the population to 10,000 individuals in 10 generations, subject to the same mutation, recombination, and selection forces as the forward-time simulation.\nWith 10,000 replicates for each simulation method, we drew a sample of 700 individuals from the simulated population. We counted the number of mutants at each locus and then the number of loci in each mutation frequency class. The results from two neutral models obtained from ms and VST differed in that the VST simulations yielded less singleton variants. This difference may be partly due to the different mutation models used by the two programs. Whereas ms uses an infinite-sites model in which new mutations always lead to a new segregating site, VST uses a finite-sites mutation model where mutations can happen at existing segregating sites (Figure 1a). The allele frequency spectra of neutral and selection simulations differ only slightly because only 8.47% of the simulated region is under the influence of natural selection. We can observe a more significant difference between allele frequency spectra if we limit the loci to coding regions (Figure 1b).\nResult Attach:fig1.png\nExcept for resampling-based simulations, the allele frequency spectra of the simulated datasets are, however, different from what we observed from 700 random samples of the 1000 Genomes Project [Abecasis, et al. 2012] (Figure 1, blue bars). The observed allele frequency spectrum has more singletons than most simulated datasets, especially for coding regions of the VST simulations with natural selection. The reasons for this phenomenon can be multi-fold but we suspect that most rare variants were introduced during the rapid expansion of the European population which had a much stronger effect than natural selection in coding regions.\n"

	"content": " A General Framework for Association Analysis Using R Programs Introduction A number of rare variant association methods as well as the flexible VAT ensemble algorithm makes it possible to conveniently evaluate variant associations via different statistical options. In addition to the existing association testing framework, variant association tools can talk to R via customized R programs prepared by users. Under this mechanism, users write up an R function that analyzes data of an association testing unit (e.g., gene) and specify the output statistic that passes into VAT to create formatted text file or annotation databases. Input association data comes directly from the project database, cleaned and annotated. Users can thus focus on customizing the association analysis without having to worry about file format conversions, quality control and annotations. Multiprocessing and auto results annotation features are also supported to guarantee efficient computation and neat output. This general R interface is not only suitable for evaluating novel statistical tests for method development projects, but also good for highly customized analysis of real world data with simple R scripts.\nThe mechanism is implemented as RTest method which is available from vtools associate command interface. Please read below for instructions on preparing and executing R programs via RTest.\nDetails Interface vtools show test RTest Name: RTest Description: A general framework for association analysis using R programs usage: vtools associate --method RTest [-h] [--name NAME] [--data_cache N] script R test positional arguments: script R program to be loaded. The R script format has to follow the convention documented at http://varianttools.sf.net/Association/RTest optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit --name NAME Name of the test that will be appended to names of output fields. --data_cache N Name of R data sets to be written into cache folder, for debug purpose.  A trivial example of the R script looks like the following\n(:codestart r\n BEGINCONF [sample.size] [result] n=2 columns=2 name=beta0, beta1 column_name=estimate, p.value ENDCONF  regression = function (dat, phenotype.name, family = \u0026ldquo;gaussian\u0026rdquo;) {\ny = dat@Y[, phenotype.name] x = apply(dat@X, 1, function(i) sum(i, na.rm=T)) m = glm(y~x,family=family) return (list(sample.size=length(y), result=summary(m)$coef[,c(1,4)]))  } (:codeend\nTo use this program for data analysis,\nvtools associate variant stroke \\ -m 'RTest /path/to/regression.R --name demo --phenotype.name \u0026quot;stroke\u0026quot; --family \u0026quot;binomial\u0026quot;' \\ \\ -g refGene.name2 -j8 --to_db demo \u0026gt; demo.txt  Format You should have one main function in the R program named the same as the R script file name. This is the interface function that interacts with the RTest command, taking input parameters from command line and return output in specified format (see below for details) that can be recognized by RTest and be stored in databases. This main function can call any other R objects as long as they are available from R or implemented elsewhere in your R program.\nInput parameters The main function should be defined in the following format\n(:codestart r ScriptName \u0026lt;- function(dataname, args, **kwargs) { \u0026hellip; } (:codeend\nwhere the first argument has to be the data object variable name (e.g. dat in the regression.R example, or any other valid names you specify), followed by a few required positional arguments (e.g. phenotype.name in regression.R example which has to be passed from commandline every time the program is executed), and other keyword arguments that have default values (e.g. family in the regression.R example. If not specified from the command line it will use default value \u0026ldquo;gaussian\u0026rdquo;). The required and optional arguments can be assigned from the commandline (e.g., the --phenotype.name 'stroke' argument of vtools associate).\nOutput configuration The return object of the main R function should be a list with the properties of each element in the list been pre-specified as comment strings at the beginning of the scripts taking the following format\n# BEGINCONF # [attribute1] # name= # type= # comment= # [attribute2] # n=N # columns= # name= # column_name= # type= # comment= # ENDCONF  and the return R list object is\nlist(attribute1=..., attribute2=..., ...)   The configuration area are R comments, starts with BEGINCONF and ends with ENDCONF. Each section name corresponds to an attribute in the return R list of the main function. Values of these attributes can be R numeric, string, vector, matrix or data.frame. Other R data type are not allowed. For attributes that are single values, e.g., numeric or string, two properties can be specified: a name property (default to the same name as the R attribute\u0026rsquo;s name), atype property (default to \u0026ldquo;float\u0026rdquo;) and a comment property (default to empty string). You can set them to different values than default, or use the default value by leaving the attribute empty (e.g. the [sample.size] attribute in the regression.R example) For attributes that are R vectors or two dimensional (2D) data.frame or matrices, the property n, indicating the number of elements in the vector or number of rows in 2D objects, have to be specified. If n is not specified the attribute will be treated as a single numeric value, leading to truncated result output. Besides n, all other properties have default values same as with single value attributes which can be re-set by specifying them in the configuration. For vector objects the name property, if set, should be comma separated and have number of elements equals n. The type of all elements in a vector should be the same, so there is only one type value to be set (e.g. type=float for all the n elements). For 2D objects, an additional required property p has to be set to specify how many columns are there in the attribute. The type property now would have to have p elements separated by comma, specifying the type of each column (e.g., type=float, string for the 1st column being float and 2nd column being character string). The name property is now the name of the rows, and an additional optional column_name property can be specified for column names. The comment property, if set, should be a sentence that briefly describes the entire section, not specific to certain row or column.  It is important that the return R object matches the descriptions in the configuration area. If the configuration area is not found in the R script, no output will be written to result databases. This is allowed because there are usage cases that does not need any output, e.g., you write an R program to plot some graphical summary of the association testing unit rather than performing association analysis and calculate p-values.\nData structure Data from vtools associate are passed into the main R function taking a variable name defined by the first argument of the function. For example if the first argument name is dat then you should manipulate the R variable dat in your R program. The dat object contains 3 default attributes and two optional attributes.\nDefault attributes\n R variable dat@name is a single character string which is the association testing group name of the data set. For example if the command is vtools associate ... -m ' ... ' --group_by refGene.name2, then the group name will be refseq gene names. If no --group_by option is used the group name will be chromosome:position of a variant. R variable dat@X is a data.frame with rows being samples (row names are sample names) and columns being variants (column names are chromosome:position of variants). The samples match the vtools associate ... --samples specification, and the variants are the ones in the variant_table specified by the association command vtools associate variant_table ... R variable dat object, although you can also pass the names of these phenotype/covariates to the R function and refer to the columns by their names (e.g., the phenotype.name specification in the regression.R example)  Optional attributes\n R variable dat@V is a data.frame of variant information corresponding to --var_info option in vtools associate command. The rows are variants (row names are chromosome:position) and columns are variant information / annotation field names. R variable dat@G is a list of data.frame of genotype information corresponding to --geno_info option in vtools associate command. Each attribute in the list is a data.frame with rows being samples and columns being the genotype information of each genotype call in a sample, e.g., the genotype quality, imputation scores, etc.  Cautions This R interfacing mechanism is flexible, and fragile at the same time, because the RTest method of vtools associate will have no control over what are implemented inside the R program. It assumes the R program the users provide is flawless and can result in exactly the same output as specified in the configuration area. If any errors occurs in the program, RTest will not attempt to fix it. It instead will simply flag an association test as \u0026ldquo;failed\u0026rdquo;. If you run an genome-wide association scan with your R program via RTest method and noticed all tests failed, its most likely your R program is problematic.\nDebug suggestions  All error messages will be written to the project log file for you to look into. Take a look at the log file to figure out why failures occur and fix your R code. A more advance option is to write out one or two groups of data with the R code to test interactively in R to see what\u0026rsquo;s going wrong. The --data_cache N option will output N R scripts per thread with data-set coded in it, to cache folder. The file name will be [Association Group Name].dat.R. For debug purpose you can add --data_cache 1 to the association command and run the command on a small variant table, find the R data file in cache, load it in R and play with the data-set to make sure your R function works, then remove the --data_cache option to actually perform association scans.  Example We provide some R interface examples for RTest method as extensions to the standard routines vtools associate provides. These examples are meant to be demonstrations for RTest method and are not thoroughly tested for use in a production environment. You are welcome to engineer them to better shape and use for your projects. We and other uses would appreciate it if you are willing to share your R program to the developers mailinglist (varianttools-devel@lists.sourceforge.net) and allow us to publish on this website for others to use.\n MetaSKAT analysis?, contributed by Gao Wang (varianttools-devel) and Raphael Mourad (University of Chicago) The RAssociation package  "

When reference and alternative variants have common leading alleles, variant positions are adjusted. For example, 10, ACG, A will be imported as variant CG,- at position 11. The Common ending alleles are also removed. We remove common leading alleles greedily to avoid ambiguity. For example, deletion TCGC-\u0026gt;GC (case * in the table) can be intepretted as a deletion of GC at pos + 2 and CG at pos + 1, variant tools uses the first interpretation. When there are multiple alternative variants, they are treated as multiple variants. If a sample with two alternative variants are imported, the sample will have other type for this variant, in contrast to homozygote (two identical alternative variant) and heterozygote (one reference and one alternative variant. Although indels could be imported, annotation database for these kinds of variants are, essentially, non-exist at this time. Using command vtools import --format ANNOVAR to import annotation for ANNOVAR might be a good choice.  "

It uses hg19 of human reference genome and assumes paired-end reads in plain text and compressed formats. Available pipelines: align Pipeline \u0026quot;align\u0026quot;: Align raw reads from input files using bwa, gatk, and picard. This pipeline accepts raw input files in plain text format, SAM/BAM format, and their compressed versions (.zip, .tar.gz, .tgz, .bz2, .tbz2 etc). All input files are assumed to be raw reads from the same sample. This pipeline generates a calibrated bam file (--output), and its reduced version if an additional output file is specified. align_0: Check the version of variant tools (version 2.1.1 and above is required to execute this pipeline) align_1: Check if a name has been asigned to the job align_2: Check path to GATK jar file align_3: Check path to Picard jar file align_10: Check existence of commands bwa, samtools and java align_11: Check the version of bwa. Version is 0.7.4 is recommended align_12: Check the version of picard. Version is 1.82 is recommended. align_13: Check the version of GATK. Version 3.3 is recommended. align_20: Check existence of class files for Picard and GATK align_50: Download the GATK resource bundle to resource directory align_60: Build bwa index for build hg19 of reference genome align_100: Convert bam files to paired fastq files if the input is in bam/sam format. Other input files are returned untouched. align_101: Decompress all input files (.tgz2, .tar, .tar.gz, .gz, .tgz, .zip etc) to a cache directory. Uncompressed files are hard- linked to the cache directory. align_200: Check the format of the input fastq file and write an option file with option -I if the sequences are in Illumina 1.3+ format. align_201: Call bwa aln to produce .sai files align_300: Running bwa sampe for paired end reads, using read group tag saved in a .RG file align_302: Check the proportion of aligned reads and exit if there are less than 80% of aligned reads. align_303: If in production mode, remove fastq files dumped from bam files align_400: Merge per-lane sam files into a single bam file. This step is skipped if there is only one input file. align_500: Sort merged bam file using picard SortSam align_501: If in production mode, remove decompressed fastq and individual bam files after a single bam file has been produced. align_600: Mark duplicates using picard MarkDuplicates command align_601: Remove _sorted.bam file after deduplication is completed. align_610: Index dedupped bam file using samtools align_700: Realign indels create indel realigner target align_710: Apply indel realigner target to bam file align_711: If in production mode, remove bam files before realignment steps align_800: Create base recalibrator target align_810: Apply base recalibrator target align_811: If in production mode, remove bam files before realignment steps align_900: Generated bam file with reduced reads if more than one output file is specified align_1000: Send a warning message if default read group is used. align_1001: Send a warning message if default read group is used. Pipeline parameters: name Name of the job to be executed. All intermediate files generated from this pipeline will be saved to $CACHE_DIR/$NAME where $CACHE_DIR is the cache directory of the project. strict_prog_version Whether or not use other version of programs if the exact version does not exist. Setting it to False allows variant tools to use other versions of the programs. (default: False) production If set to True or 1, all intermediate files will be removed. The whole pipeline would need to be rerun if a different parameter or different version of external program is used. (default: False) picard_path Path to picard jar files gatk_path Path to GATK jar file GenomeAnalysisTK.jar rgid Read group ID (default: 1) rglb Read group Library. (default: LIB) rgpl Read group Platform (default: Illumina) rgsm Read group sample name. Value of parameter --name will be used if this parameter is left unspecified. rgpu Read group platform unit (e.g. flowcall-barcode.lane). (default: FC.1) opt_java Option to java program. -Djava.io.tmpdir is frequently used to set java temporary directory if system temporary partition is not big enough.

The pipeline expects to use certain versions of the tools. You can pass \u0026ndash;strict_version no to use newer tools but the pipeline might not work as expected. Paths to Picard and GATK should be passed using options gatk_path and picard_path.\nTest the environment After you installed the programs, you should running the following commands to test if everything works ok:\n# create a new project and download test data (an online snapshot) % vtools init test --parent vt_illuminaTestData % vtools execute bwa_gatk33_hg19 align --input illumina_test_seq.tar.gz --output test.bam \\ --gatk_path /path/to/gatk --picard_path /path/to/picard --name test  This command will not only test the availability of tools, but also download all required resource files and build necessary indexes.\nExecuting the pipeline in production mode The pipeline will by default keep all intermediate files. If you restart the pipeline with different parameter or a different version of an external file, only the affected steps will be repeated. Intermediate files will be reused if available. This allows you to examine and fine-tune the pipeline to make sure it works as expected.\nBecause intermediate files can be large, an option --production true is provided to execute the pipeline in production mode. In this mode, most intermediate files will be removed after the completion of the steps that make use of them. The pipeline can resume from the right step if it is interrupted, but has to be re-executed from the beginning if a result file is removed.\n"

	"content": " Reference sequence around variant site Usage Function ref_sequence(chr, start, end) returns the reference sequence between start and end on chromosome chr of the reference genome (primary reference genome unless parameter --build is used to specify an alternative reference genome). If end is unspecified, ref_sequence(chr, pos) returns the reference allele at the specified location. This function is very useful in output the context of variants or select variants based on the contexts (e.g. select variants in CpG islands).\nSimply put, function ref_sequence in\n% vtools output variant chr pos 'ref_sequence(chr, pos)'  returns the nucleotide at the variant site, and\n% vtools output variant chr pos 'ref_sequence(chr, pos, pos+5)'  returns the 5-base sequence at and after the variant sites, for all variants in the master variant table.\nDetails  Examples: output reference sequence around variants Let us get a test project\n% vtools admin --load_snapshot vt_simple Downloading snapshot vt_simple.tar.gz from online INFO: Snapshot vt_simple has been loaded  We can check if the imported reference alleles is consistent with the reference genome:\n% vtools output variant chr pos ref 'ref_sequence(chr, pos)' -l 10 1 4540 G G 1 5683 G G 1 5966 T T 1 6241 T T 1 9992 C C 1 9993 G G 1 10007 G G 1 10098 G G 1 14775 G G 1 16862 A A  This means that we used the correct build of reference genome to import the data (c.f. vtools admin --validate_build). If we are interested in the up and down stream sequence of variants, we can use function ref_sequence,\n% vtools output variant chr pos ref 'ref_sequence(chr, pos-5, pos+5)' -l 10 1 4540 G GGGGGGAAGGT 1 5683 G CTGCTGCTTCT 1 5966 T GTGTGTGGGGG 1 6241 T AGGAATGGGGA 1 9992 C GGCCGCGGTGA 1 9993 G GCCGCGGTGAG 1 10007 G CAGGGGCCAGC 1 10098 G ATCTCGAGTCA 1 14775 G GGAGCGTCAGA 1 16862 A CCAGGAAGGTG  Now, if you are interested in checking if the variants happen in a region with high concentration of reference alleles (e.g. a repeatitive region), you can use an expression to calculate the concentration of reference allele in the region. For example, the following expression first gets the reference sequence of length 11 around the variant ((ref_sequence(chr, pos-5, pos+5)), remove all occurance of reference allele (replace(SEQ, ref, \u0026quot;\u0026quot;), and count the number of remaining alleles:\n% vtools update variant --set 'nRef=11-length(replace(ref_sequence(chr, pos-5, pos+5), ref, \u0026quot;\u0026quot;))' INFO: Adding variant info field nRef  The resulting new column nRef records the number of reference alleles in the 11 basepair regions around the variants:\n% vtools output variant chr pos ref 'ref_sequence(chr, pos-5, pos+5)' nRef -l 10 1 4540 G GGGGGGAAGGT 8 1 5683 G CTGCTGCTTCT 2 1 5966 T GTGTGTGGGGG 3 1 6241 T AGGAATGGGGA 1 1 9992 C GGCCGCGGTGA 3 1 9993 G GCCGCGGTGAG 6 1 10007 G CAGGGGCCAGC 5 1 10098 G ATCTCGAGTCA 2 1 14775 G GGAGCGTCAGA 5 1 16862 A CCAGGAAGGTG 3  (:exampleend\n"

CMC method considers all variants in a test unit (e.g., a gene). It \u0026ldquo;collapses\u0026rdquo; all rare variants in the gene region such that the region is coded \u0026ldquo;0\u0026rdquo; if all loci are wildtype, and \u0026ldquo;1\u0026rdquo; if any one locus has a minor allele. Then it \u0026ldquo;combines\u0026rdquo; this coding with the rest of common variants in the gene region into a multivariate problem that tests for the null hypothesis that the gene region is not associated with a disease or quantitative trait. The statistic for CMC method can be {$\\chi^2$} test for collapsed rare variants, Hotelling\u0026rsquo;s {$T^2$} or multivariate regression analysis for joint analysis of common and rare variants. This program implements CMC method for rare variants with Fisher\u0026rsquo;s exact test for evaluating association between rare variants and disease phenotypes (case/ctrl data). The use of Fisher\u0026rsquo;s test results in exact p-value, avoiding the computationally intensive permutation procedure.\nThis test only works for case control data without covariates. Please refer to CollapseBt and CollapseQt for case control and quantitative traits using the collapsing theme under regression framework that incorporates covariates.\nDetails Command interface vtools show test CFisher Name: CFisher Description: Fisher's exact test on collapsed variant loci, Li \u0026amp; Leal 2008 usage: vtools associate --method CFisher [-h] [--name NAME] [-q1 MAFUPPER] [-q2 MAFLOWER] [--alternative TAILED] [--midp] [--moi {additive,dominant,recessive}] Collapsing test for case-control data (CMC test, Li \u0026amp; Leal 2008).

	"content": " Specification of a variant tools pipeline This page describes the new pipeline format (version 1.1 and later). Please refer to Format1_0? if you are editing a pipeline specification file for variant tools 2.7 and earlier..\nIntxroduction Variant Tools uses pipeline specification files to define pipelines. A pipeline specification file can define multiple pipelines. It can be stored locally or online in the variant tools repository (or a local repository maintained by your system adminstrator). You can use command\n% vtools show pipelines  to get a list of all publicly available pipelines, and\n% vtools show pipeline SPECFILE  to get the details of pipelines defined in SPECFILE. The output of this command consists of description of the SPECFILE, all pipelines in it, steps of each pipeline, and options of the pipelines.\nA pipeline can be executed by command\n% vtools execute SPECFILE PIPELINE [--input XXX] [--output XXX] [OPTIONS]  where SPECFILE can be a local .pipeline file, or name of an online pipeline specification file, PIPELINE is the name of the pipeline defined in SPECFILE. The command line can be simplified to\n% vtools execute SPECFILE [-i XXX] [-o XXX] [OPTIONS]  if the spec file only defines one pipeline.\nThe format of pipeline spec files is similar to the .ini files of the good old days. It is not as fashionable as XML based configuration files but it is easier to read and write. The most simple pipeline specification file is a collection of commands and scripts as follows\n###fileformat=PIPELINE1.1 # Copyright, change log etc # This is a description of all pipelines defined in this spec file [1] RunCommand(cmd='a shell command') [2] ExecuteRScript(script=''' library(mylib) a \u0026lt;- read.table(\u0026quot;${var2}.txt\u0026quot;) ''')  although a spec file that defines multiple pipelines, accepts multiple command line parameters and makes uses of pipeline variables looks as follows:\n  output\u0026lt;\n  ###fileformat=PIPELINE1.1 # Copyright, change log etc # This is a description of all pipelines defined in this spec file # p1_description: The p1 pipeline performs ... p2_description: The p1 pipeline performs ... # pipeline variables VAR=VALUE VAR1=VALUE1 [DEFAULT] arg1= This argument does this arg2=1.0 This argument has a default value 1.0 [*_10: passthrough] # Check the version of variant tools CheckVariantToolVersion('2.7') [p1_20] # Execute a single command input: ${cmd_input} RunCommand(cmd=''' a very long command \u0026gt; ${var1} ''', output='${var1}') [p1_200] # Execute a R script ExecuteRScript(script=''' library(mylib) a \u0026lt;- read.table(\u0026quot;${var2}.txt\u0026quot; ''', output='${var2[:-3]}.pdf') [p2_20] # Execute a R script for pipeline p2 ExecuteRScript(script=''' library(mylib) a \u0026lt;- read.table(\u0026quot;${var2}.txt\u0026quot; ''', output='${var2[:-3]}.pdf')  This small example demonstrates almost all the features of pipeline specification files. Before we go to the details of each section, here are some basic rules:\n A spec file should start with line\n##fileformat=PIPELINE1.1\n Lines starts with # are comments. Some comments are significant and will be displayed in the output of vtools show pipeline.\n A pipeline spec file consists of a starting description section with no header, an optional [DEFAULT] section, and multiple pipeline step sections.\n Values of an item can be expanded into multiple lines, e.g.\nname=this is a long text that continues to the second line or the third\n  Consequently, you can expand your comments or commands into several lines as long as you do not start from the first column. An exception to this rule is when a large piece of text is quoted in triple quotes such as\nExecuteRScript(''' data \u0026lt;- read.table(\u0026quot;${input}\u0026quot;) data \u0026lt;- data[1,] ''')  Note that ''' ... ''' literals are automatically translated to r''' ... ''' so escape characters are not translated. Use \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; ... \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; string literals if you would like to allow escape characters.\n You can use either KEY = VALUE or KEY : VALUE. The convention is to use KEY = VALUE for variable assignment and KEY : VALUE for all other.\n Pattern ${ } are specially handled as pipeline variables. ; and % are not special characters as in the original specification format.\n  Top Section A pipeline specification file should start with a description section (no header is needed). This section should have the following keys:\n description: Summary of pipelines defined in this SPECFILE, which should include format and type of input data (raw reads? bam file? paired end?), external commands that are used, a short description of steps involved, and reference to external documentation if available. If no description is provided, the second block of comments will be treated as overall pipeline description in the output of vtools show pipeline. For example,\n##fileformat=PIPELINE1.1\nCopyright line This is the overall pipeline description #\n PIPELINE_description: (Optional) Description of pipeline PIPELINE. PIPELINE has to be a valid pipeline defined in this file (with sections PIPELINE_XX).\n  If you have long descriptions (highly recommended!), you can break it into several paragraphs by adding HTML tags \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; or \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;. Tag \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; starts a new paragraph (two newlines) and tag \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; starts a new line (one newline). You can also use tags  and  to generate itemized lists. For example,\nThis pipeline uses \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt; \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;tophat 2.0.13 \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;bowtie 1.1.1 \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;samtools 0.1.19 \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;picard 1.82 \u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt;  will produce output\nThis pipeline uses * tophat 2.0.13 * bowtie 1.1.1 * samtools 0.1.19 * picard 1.82  when the description is outputted using command vtools show pipeline.\n NAME=VAL (optional): Pipeline variables. This is usually a good place to define constant values that will be used by pipeline steps. For example:\nRESOURCE_DIR=${local_resource}/pipeline_resource/name_of_pipeline   where ${local_resource} is another pipeline variable that has value of project runtime option $local_resource. We will talk about pipeline variables in details later.\nSection [DEFAULT] (command line options) The DEFAULT section defines parameters that can be changed using command line arguments. For example, in the following .pipeline file (partial)\n[DEFAULT] opt_java=-Xmx4g Parameter passed to the java command, default to -Xmx4g to use a maximum of 4g heap space. [align_5] RunCommand(cmd=\u0026quot;java ${opt_java} SortSam ...\u0026quot;)  The value of opt_java will be used to replace all instances of ${opt_java} in the pipeline configuration file (or its derivatives, more on this later). The parameter has a default value -Xmx4g and a help message, which will be displayed when you view the details of this parameter.\n% vtools show pipeline my_pipeline  you will see at the end of the output the following description:\nPipeline parameters: opt_java Parameter passed to the java command, default to -Xmx4g to use a maximum of 4g heap space. (default: -Xmx4g)  That is to say, you can pass an alternative value of opt_java to this format using command-line options such as --opt_java -Xmx32g to change the value of this option.\nIf you have a large number of parameters, you can save them to an external file, one item per line, and load them by prefixing filename with a \u0026quot;@\u0026quot; symbol. For example, if you have a file param.cfg with content\n--bwa /path/to/bwa --samtools /path/to/samtools  you can load parameters --bwa /path/to/bwa --samtools /path/to/samtools using \u0026quot;@param.cfg\u0026quot; from command line.\nYou do not have to define parameter --input and --output but it is a good practice to define them in this section to provide description of the input and output of the pipeline.\nPipeline variables Definition of pipeline variables Pipeline variables are variables associated with the execution of pipeline. They are added with the progression of the pipeline and provides runtime information for each step. All pipelines starts with the following variables:\n Command line options: All command line options will be passed as pipeline variables as a list of strings, with the exceptions for  ${cmd_input} for option --input ${cmd_output} for option --output Pipeline output , which will be ['data.bam'] for the above mentioned example. It does not have to a list of files. For example, it can be used to specify output directory or   For example, ${cmd_input} and ${cmd_output} will be ['data.tgz'] and ['data.bam'] respectively for command vtools execute bwa_gatk28_hg19 align --input data.tgz --output data.bam.\n A pipeline starts by default with ${cmd_input} as input files but it can start without any input, or from another variable. ${cmd_input} and ${cmd_output} will always be a list even if only one input or output file is passed. ${cmd_input} and @@${cmd_output} do not have to be a list of files. For example they can be used to specify input and output directories.\n Execution environment including\n ${vtools_version}: Version of variant tools (e.g. 2.0.2) used to execute the pipeline. ${spec_file}: Full path of the specfile in which the pipeline is defined. ${pipeline_name} and ${model_name}: Name of the pipeline. The name MODEL_NAME is preferred when the pipeline is used in variant simulation tools. ${pipeline_step}: Current step in the pipeline (as a string). ${ref_genome_build}: Primary build of the reference genome of the project (e.g. hg19). ${local_resource}: Project resource directory (runtime variable $local_resource). ${cache_dir}: Project cache directory, which is usually used to store all intermediate files of a pipeline. ${temp_dir}: Project temporary directory ($temp_dir), which can be used to store, for example, java temp directories. This directory can be set by runtime option $temp_dir. A system temp directory will be used if the pipeline is executed without a variant tools project. ${model_name} and SEED: Name of the simulation model (pipeline) and seed. Used by Variant Simulation Tools?. ${home}: user\u0026rsquo;s home directory. ${working_dir} Working directory, which is default to current directory.   User-defined variables defined in the top section and pipeline sections. The top section usually defines constant that will be used later. The pipeline sections usually define variables as a result of certain action.\n  You can override some execution environment variables by re-defining it in the top section. In particular, if you define ${working_dir} in the top section of the spec file, all jobs will be executed under this directory (although some actions can have their own working directories).\n Runtime variables including\n ${input} as input to actions because an action might be repeated for each input files.   Use of Pipline variables It is important to remember that\n Pipeline variables are case-insensitive, read only, and can be only string or list of strings. List of strings are joined by space when they are outputted. All file-list variables such as cmd_input, cmd_output, input, inputXXX, outputXXX (where XXX is step of pipeline) and their aliases are list of strings, even if there is only one file in the list. All command line arguments are list of strings. All other variables such as user-defined variables can hold string only.  For example, if the value of variable cmd_input is ['file1.txt', 'file2.txt'], they will appear as file1.txt file2.txt when ${cmd_input} is used in a command line (with proper quotation).\nIf you need to access one or more elements of the list of strings, use variables such as ${input[0]}, ${cmd_output[-1]}, ${input[2:]} and ${input[0][:-3]}.\nIf you need to output pipeline variables in any other format, you can use a function form of the variable ${var: lambda_func} using Python lambda function. For example,\n${cmd_output: os.path.basename(cmd_output[0])}  passes value of cmd_output to a Python lambda function lambda x: os.path.basename(x[0]), which will be \u0026quot;output.bam\u0026quot; if ${cmd_output} equals to \u0026quot;/path/to/output.bam\u0026quot;.\n${input: ','.join(sorted([x for x in input if '_R1_' in x]))}  takes a list of input files, select files with _R1_ in filename, sort them, and output them as comma-separated list.\nThis mechanism is very powerful in that the lambda function can take zero or more than one pipeline variables. For example\nhostname=${: subprocess.check_output(\u0026quot;hostname\u0026quot;)}  returns the output of the hostname command\n${input,cmd_output: OS.PATH.JOIN(cmd_output[0], input[0])}   Use of shell variables (e.g. use a for loop in action RunCommand) is possible but can be tricky because pipeline and shell variables can take the same form. Whereas simple form of shell variables ($VAR instead of ${var}) can be used without problem, the brace form ${var} will trigger a warning message if VAR is a not valid pipeline variable, and return unexpected results otherwise. Pipeline variables can use functions from common Python modules such as os, sys, glob, subprocess, and functions defined in modules imported using action ImportModule. If you need more modules, you can import them using inline script of action ImportModule.  Step sections Name of step sections [PIPELINE], [XX], [PIPELINE_XX], or [PIPELINE_XX,PIPELINE1_XX], or [*_XX] A pipeline is, roughly speaking, a pipe that connects the input (e.g. raw reads in fastq format) to the output (e.g. aligned reads in bam format), going through a few steps (actions) along the way. A pipeline specification file can define multiple pipelines with different PIPELINE. Steps in a pipeline are numbered and will be executed in such order. The indexes of actions do not have to be consecutive so align_10, align_20, and align_30 are acceptable. They do not even have to be defined in the order they are be executed.\nIf your pipeline contains only one step, you can just define a section as follows\n[test_env]  If your spec file defines only one pipeline or if you would like to define a default pipeline that will be executed without specifying a name, you can specify this pipeline without name, e.g.\n[100] [200]  Otherwise you can define multiple multi-step pipelines like\n[EU_10] [EU_20] [AF_10] [AF_20]  A section can define multiple pipeline steps if the same step can be used for multiple steps of a pipeline or for other pipelines in the same file. For example\n[EU_100,EU_200,EU_300] [100, EU_100,AF_100,GT_100]  can be used to perform the same action for steps 100, 200, and 300 of pipeline EU, or the same step 100 for pipelines default, EU, AF and GT. In the latter case, you can even use wildcard character\n[*_100]  to define a step that will be executed by all pipelines defined in this file.\nContent of pipeline step sections For each step of a pipeline, we need to know\n What are the input files How to process input files? One by one or altogether? What actions should be applied to the input files? What are the outputs?  Answers of these questions should be specified using the following keys:\n input (optional). List of input files for a step. The default value of the input is the output of the previous step (or the command input for the first step). One or more files could be specified explicitly (separated by space). For example,\noutput of step 400, not from previous step input: ${output400}\noutput from multiple steps input: ${output400} ${output500}\nall files in a directory input: ${:glob.glob(\u0026rsquo;*.gz\u0026rsquo;)}\n A pipeline will be terminated if there is no input file or if any of the specified input files does not exist.\n input options (optional). By default, all input files are passed together to the action (so ${input} equals to ${inputxxx} where XXX is number of pipeline step. You can change this behavior by setting one or more input options, which are specified by one or more comma-separated opt=val options in the format of\ninput: input_files : option1, option2, option3\n  For example, the following example select all fastq files from input files and send them to pipeline action in pairs:\ninput: ${cmd_input} : select='fastq', group='pair'  Variant Tools currently provides the following options:\n \u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;group_by='all' Eligible files are by default sent altogether (group_by='all') to action (group_by='all', ${input} equals to ${input#} where # is the index of step), but can also be sent individually (group_by='single', ${input} is a list of a single file), or in pairs (group_by='paired', e.g. filename_1.txt and filename_2.txt).\n select=True/False/'fastq'/... select can be True (all input file), False (no input file, the step will be skipped), 'fastq' (ignore file extension and check content of files), or one or more file extensions (e.g. ['sam', 'bam']).\n pass_unselected=True: If files are not used (pass through), unselected files are by default passed directly as output of a step.\n skip=True/False: Skip an step if set to True (which is usually a variable. All input files will be passed directly to output by default.\n  An input option does not substitute ${input} because it determines ${input}. They can however use other variables such as ${cmd_output}. For example,\n${bam_files} : ${input200:len(input200)==1})  select files only if there are more than one input file. This is useful, for example, to merge bam files only if there are more than one input bam files.\n action (required): An action that will be executed by variant tools, sometimes repeatedly for different input files (e.g. for each or each pair of input files). Each action will return a list of output files, which will form the output files of the step. A list of actions can be specified in the format of Action1, Action2, .... These actions will be executed sequentially and the output of a previous action will become the input of the following action. Please check the actions section for a list of available actions. The action= key can be ignored..\n NAME=VALUE (optional): This allows the pipeline step to define some pipeline variable with results obtained by the step. For example, if this step writes an optional flag in file file1.txt, you can use\nflag=${: open(\u0026ldquo;file1.txt\u0026rdquo;).read() }\n  to save its content to a pipeline variable.\nIf an action differ only slightly across pipelines, you can use variable ${pipeline_name} to perform different actions for different pipelines. For example,\n[eu_100,af_100] ..... ${pipeline_name: '-g' if PIPELINE_NAME='eu' else ''}  uses passes an additional option -g to an action for pipeline eu.\nComments in pipeline steps will be displayed in the output of vtools show pipeline:\n[hg19_100] # decompress input files only if they are compressed DecompressFiles(...)  Section options ([pipeline_100: output_alias=hits]) Pipeline steps accept a few options that tells variant tools how to handle input and output files. These options are specified in section head after section names in the format of\n[[p1_10, p2_20 : option1, option2]]  Variant Tools currently supports the following options\n independent. This option tells variant tools that a step does not belong to a pipeline and there is no need to track input and output of it. The variable ${input} will be undefined for this step and its output will not be passed to the next step. This option should be used for steps such as CheckVariantToolsVersion, DownloadResource that are independent of input files.\n no_input: The step does not need any input file to generate output. Because variant tools terminates a pipeline if there is no input file, this option allows the starting or continuation of pipeline with no input file.\n blocking: The step is shared by multiple instance of the pipelines and can only be executed by one instance. If multiple instances are running, only the first one will execute it and the rest of them will wait for the output to be generated. This option should be used for steps to download data, to generate index et al.\n input_alias=another_name and output_alias=another_name: Assign variableanother_nameto the input and output of the step, respectively. This option is very useful to give output of a step a meaningful name so that the subsequent steps can refer to them by this name. In the following example, pipeline variable${accepted_hits}becomes an alias to${output200}after the execution ofhg19_200@@, and can be used in later sections.\n[hg19_200: output_alias=accepted_hits] RunCommand(\u0026lsquo;tophat \u0026hellip;.\u0026rsquo;)\n[hg19_210] \u0026hellip;\n[hg19_200] input: ${accepted_hits} RunCommand(\u0026lsquo;\u0026hellip;\u0026rsquo;)\n  Available actions Actions are functions that are executed by Variant Tools.\nTechnically speaking, pipeline actions are evaluated as a Python expression to obtain a PipelineAction object. That is to say, you can use arbitrary python expressions such as list comprehension for this item.\nGiven an action, variant tools\n Replace ${name} with corresponding pipeline variable NAME. Lambda functions such as {:EXPR}, {NAME:EXPR}, {NAME1,NAME2:EXPR} etc will be evaluated before they are substituted. Evaluate the text as a Python expression to obtain an PipelineAction object that will be called by Variant Tools. Python functions and expressions will be evaluated during this step.  For example, for the following action,\nCheckDirs([\u0026quot;${resource_dir}\u0026quot;, os.path.join('${cache_dir}', '${pipeline_name}')])  will be processed as to\nCheckDirs([\u0026quot;/path/to/resource\u0026quot;, os.path.join('cache', 'EUS')])  with command line option --resource_dir /path/to/resource (or use default value defined in section DEFAULT), and values of pipeline variables CACHE_DIR and PIPELINE_NAME, and finally be evaluated to produce an object CheckDirs with parameters:\nCheckDirs([\u0026quot;/path/to/resource\u0026quot;, 'cache/EUS'])  There are two kinds of pipeline actions\n Built-in actions: Actions that are defined by variant tools.\n Pipeline-defined actions: Actions that are defined by users of variant tools pipeline. They are defined in .py files and need to be imported to a pipeline using action ImportModules.\n  Because of the increasing number of pipeline actions, variant tools provides a command\n% vtools show actions  to list all built-in action (for variant tools and variant simulation tools), and actions defined by pipelines in the variant tools repository. You can check the details of each action using command\n% vtools show action ACTION  For example, you can use command\n% vtools show action TerminateIf Help on class TerminateIf in module variant_tools.pipeline: class TerminateIf(PipelineAction) | Terminate a pipeline if a condition is not met. | | Examples: | TerminateIf(not '${cmd_output}', 'No --output is specified.') | | Methods defined here: | | __call__(self, ifiles, pipeline=None) | Terminate the pipeline if specified condition is met. | | Parameters: | ifiles: unused | pipeline: unused | | Results: | Pass input to output. Does not change pipeline. | | Raises: | A RuntimeError will be raised to terminate the pipeline if | the condition is met. | | __init__(self, cond, message) | Parameters: | cond (boolean): | True or False. In practice, ``cond`` is usually | a lambda function that checks the existence of a file or value | of a pipeline variable. | | message (string): | A message to be outputted when the condition is met. | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | Methods inherited from PipelineAction: | | execute(self, ifiles, pipeline=None) | Function called by __call__ for actual action performed on ifiles. A user-defined | action should re-define __call__ or redefine this function and return ``True`` if the | action is completed successfully.  to check the details of action TerminateIf.\nBrief description of built-in actions The following is a partial list of built-in actions defined by variant tools. The descriptions are brief and might have been outdated so please use command above to check the latest documentation.\n CheckVariantToolsVersion(ver): Check the version of variant tools. Stop the pipeline if it is not recent enough to execute the pipeline.\n CheckCommands(cmds): Check the existence of command cmds and raise an error if the command does not exist. Input files of the step is passed directly as output files.\n CheckFiles(files, msg=''): Check the existence of specified files. This can be used to check, for example, the existence of the .jar file of GATK. An error message can be specified.\n CheckDirs(dirs, msg=''): Check the existence of specified directories. An error message can be specified.\n CheckOutput(cmd, patterns, failIfMismatch=True): Check the output of a command and see if it matches one of the specified patterns (see the search function of Python re package for details). The pipeline will be terminated if failIfMismatch is set to True (default). This action is usually used to check the version of commands.\n Check for a specific version of bwa\nCheckOutput(\u0026lsquo;bwa\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Version: 0.7.4\u0026rsquo;)\n Check for multiple allowed versions of bwa\nCheckOutput(\u0026lsquo;bwa\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Version: 0.7.*\u0026lsquo;)\n Check version of picard\nCheckOutput(\u0026lsquo;ls %(picard_path)s/picard*.jar\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;picard-1.82\u0026rsquo;)\n Check version of GATK\nCheckOutput(\u0026lsquo;java -jar %(gatk_path)/GenomeAnalysisTK.jar -version\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;^2.4\u0026rsquo;)\n Check version of MosaikAligner\nCheckOutput(\u0026lsquo;MosaikAligner -version\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;2.1\u0026rsquo;)\n DownloadResource(resource, dest_dir): Download a list of resources (URLs) (a single string, URLs can be separated by spaces or newlines) to a pipeline resource directory resource_dir. The resources will not be downloaded if the files already exist. .gz files will be decompressed automatically. If both filename and filename.md5 exist, the md5 signature of filename will be compared to filename.md5. resource_dir will be locked during downloading so only one process can execute this step at any time.\n RunCommand(cmd, working_dir=None, output=[], submitter=None): Execute cmd (one command or a list of commands) under working directory working_dir (default to current project directory). A list of output files specified by output will be returned. If output is specified, three additional files, filename.out#, filename.err#, filename.exe_info (where filename is the first file in output) will be produced with command output, command error output, and command execution information, respectively. Command execution information contains command executed, start and ending time, file size and md5 signature of input and output files. If output files already exist, newer than input files, size and md5 checksum of input and output files and command used match what have been recorded in filename.exe_info, the command will not be executed. Because valid filename.exe_info files are only created after commands are completed successfully (not interrupted), a pipeline can be safely resumed if it is terminated due to user or system errors.\n Multiple commands could be executed in a single RunCommand action. The pipeline will terminate if any of the commands returns non-zero code.\n Using option output to specify output files is highly recommended because otherwise the command will be re-executed if the pipeline is re-executed. If the command does not produce any new output (e.g. many vtools commands), you can generate a status output file and use it as output, as in\nRunCommand(cmd=[\u0026lsquo;vtools import ${input: \u0026ldquo; \u0026ldquo;.join(input)} \u0026ndash;build hg19\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;vtools show genotypes \u0026gt; genotype.lst\u0026rsquo;], output=\u0026lsquo;genotype.lst\u0026rsquo;)\n If a valid working_dir is set, the child process in which the commands are executed will switch to this directory but the current directory of the master process will remain the same. That is to say, all input and output filenames etc are still relative to the project path, but os.path.abspath might be needed if these path are used in the cmd.\n If a submitter is defined, the submission command will be used to run the commands in background (e.g. submitter='sh {} \u0026amp;') or as a separate job (e.g. @@submitter=\u0026lsquo;qsub {}\u0026rsquo;). This allows parallel execution of pipeline steps.\n If no output is specified, input files are passed through as output files.\n  Arbitrary command could be defined for this action, which in theory could destroy all your data or system. It is your responsibility to verify that a pipeline description file does not contain malicious piece of code and we (developers of variant tools) are not responsible for any damage that might have been caused.\n ExecuteRScript(script, working_dir=None, output=[], submitter=None): Execute an in-line R script.\n ExecuteShellScript(script, working_dir=None, output=[], submitter=None): Execute an in-line shell script.\n ExecutePythonScript(script, working_dir=None, output=[], submitter=None): Execute an in-line Python script.\n ExecutePython3Script(script, working_dir=None, output=[], submitter=None): Execute an in-line Python3 script.\n ExecutePerlScript(script, working_dir=None, output=[], submitter=None): Execute an in-line Perl script.\n ExecuteRubyScript(script, working_dir=None, output=[], submitter=None): Execute an in-line Ruby script.\n  Define your own pipeline actions You can define your pipeline actions to perform steps that cannot be performed by an existing command. There are several ways to achieve this.\n For simple tasks that can be achieved using shell script, Python script, R script etc, use actions such as ExecuteShellScript.\n If the steps requires processing of a single file, you can define an in-line action using action ExecutePythonCode. This action looks like\nExecutePythonCode(=\u0026ldquo;\u0026rsquo; with open(\u0026ldquo;${input:input[0]}\u0026ldquo;, \u0026lsquo;r\u0026rsquo;) as input: # process input files # generate output files # set variables to pipeline.VARS (e.g. pipeline.VARS[\u0026lsquo;read_length\u0026rsquo;] = 100) \u0026ldquo;\u0026lsquo;)\n  The difference between ExecutePythonCode and ExecutePythonScript is that ExcutePythonCode will be execute in the current process, and the script passed to ExecutePythonScript will be written to a Python script and called using a separate processed with optional command line options.\n If you have a complex action that involves classes and/or multiple functions, you can define the action in a .py file and import it using action ImportModule. Taking an example from RNASeq_tools.py, the @.py file looks like:\nfrom variant_tools.utils import env, calculateMD5 from variant_tools.pipeline import PipelineAction\nclass CreateRefGeneBed(PipelineAction): \u0026ldquo;\u0026lsquo;This pipeline step converts UCSC refGene.txt to BED format, to be used by tools such as RSeQC.\u0026ldquo;\u0026rsquo; def init(self, txt_file, output): PipelineAction.init(self, \u0026lsquo;CreateRefGeneBed_v1 \u0026ndash;txt_file {} {} \u0026lsquo; .format(txt_file, calculateMD5(txt_file, partial=True)), output) self.txt_file = txt_file\ndef _execute(self, ifiles, pipeline=None): with open(self.txt_file, 'rU') as ifile, open(self.output[0], 'w') as ofile: for line in ifile: ls = line.strip().split('\\t') starts = [int(x) for x in ls[9].strip(',').split(',')] stops = [int(x) for x in ls[10].strip(',').split(',')] lengths = ','.join([str(y-x) for x,y in zip(starts, stops)]) relstarts = ','.join([str(x-int(ls[4])) for x in starts]) ofile.write(\u0026quot;{0}\\t{1}\\t{2}\\t{3}\\t0\\t{4}\\t{5}\\t{6}\\t0\\t{7}\\t{8}\\t{9}\\n\u0026quot;.format( ls[2], ls[4], ls[5], ls[1], ls[3], ls[6], ls[7], ls[8], lengths, relstarts)) return True   This function converts a UCSC refGene.txt to BED format so that it can be used by tools such as RSeQC. Basically,\n A class should be derived from PipelineAction defined in variant_tools.pipeline\n It should call PipelineAction.__init__(self, cmd, output) with proper command line and expected output files so that the action will be skipped if it is called with identical signature.\n Define function _execute(self, ifiles, pipeline) to perform needed action and return output files and returns True if everything is ok. This function can generate output files, and/or set pipeline variables using pipeline.VARS[key]=value.\n Import the module to your pipeline using ImportModules('my_tools.py').\n  "

	"content": " Variant Simulation Tools A presentation about variant simulation tools (Sep. 2014)\nVariant Simulation Tools is still under development. Development (subversion) versions of Variant Tools and simuPOP are needed to use VST. Also, because of a lack of mature simulation models (only two examples in the submitted paper are available), users are strongly advised to contact me for the creation of any simulation model.\nWhat is Variant Simulation Tools Variant Simulation Tools (VST) is a simulation tool for post-GWAS genetic epidemiological studies using whole-genome or whole-exome next-gen sequencing data, with an emphasis on user-friendliness and reproducibility. Because simulating high-quality datasets for genetic epidemiological studies requires careful selection and validation of appropriate simulation method for particular applications, VST aims to provide validated application-specific simulation methods and simulated datasets. It distinguishes itself from other simulators in that\n VST provides multiple simulation engines for different simulation methods  Because different simulation methods have their own pros and cons and application areas, VST does not limit itself to a particular simulation method. Instead, it provides simulation engines for theoretical, forward-time, coalescent, and resampling-based simulations.\n VST separates simulation models from their implementations  VST uses a two-tier design. The core of VST is a set of functions to perform different tasks and is distributed with Variant Tools. Simulations are defined in simulation specification files that are stored in the variant tools repository. New simulations become available to all VST users as soon as they are uploaded to the repository.\n VST encourages reproducible simulations  Each VST simulation encapsulates simulation methods and parameters that have been used for a particular application. It allows no or only a few parameters to make it easy to reproduce a simulation. In addition to simulation models, VST also distribute simulated datasets for some simulation models, making it easier for casual users to explore the properties of selected simulation models.\nWhereas it is easy to reproduce an existing VST simulation, creating a new simulation? in VST requires some in-depth knowledge of simuPOP and variant tools. It is strongly recommended that you discuss your simulation study with other users of VST in the varianttools-user mailing list before you write your own simulations. You could also write to me directly if you would like to discuss your project in private.\nAttach:repository.jpg\nSchematic illustration of the role of the variant tools repository in the distribution of simulation models and simulated datasets. The repository provides simulation models and simulated datasets that can be downloaded using VST. Casual users can download simulated datasets and use them without running VST. Users who need to use a model without existing simulated datasets or need more replicates of an existing simulation can simulate data using VST. Advanced users who write their own simulation methods can choose to share their models with others by uploading their models to the repository.\nKey features  VST simulates real nucleotide sequences of the human genome  VST simulates human nucleotide sequences with common or rare mutations. Simulated variants (mutations) locate at specific locations of the genome (chr and pos) with reference (ref) and alternative alleles (alt). VST maps mutations to the human genome if the underlying simulation engine simulates SNP markers on hypothetical regions.\n The forward-time simulation engine knows the regions it simulate  In comparison to previous forward-time simulations that simulate hypothetical genomic regions with random fitness effect, VST * identifies all genes (isoforms) that locate within or overlap with the user-provided regions, locates exons, coding regions, and codons on the forward and reverse strands. * recombine parental chromosomes using a fine-scale genetic map with recombination rates and hotspots provided by the HapMap project * use a nucleotide mutation model to introduce new mutants to the population * determine the fitness of individuals from amino-acid changes of the translated protein sequences\n VST supports a large number of penetrance and quantitative trait models and sampling methods  The flexible design of VST allows the application of very complex penetrance and quantitative trait models to the simulated population and draw random, case control, extreme trait, and pedigree-based samples.\n Datasets simulated by VST could be exported in VCF format, or analyzed directly using Variant Association Tools  Simulated datasets could be exported and analyzed by other programs, or imported into a variant tools project and analyzed directly using Variant Association Tools?.\nBasic usages of VST Step 1: check available simulation models After installing variant tools?, run\n% vtools show simulations Peng2011_srv Re-implementation of some of the simulations performed by SRV (Peng \u0026amp; Liu, Simulating Sequences of the Human Genome with Rare Variants, 2011). Peng2014_ex1 Simulations of DNA sequences in specified regions using different simulation methods, for the first example in paper \u0026quot;Reproducible Simulations of realistic samples for next-gen sequencing studies using Variant Simulation Tools\u0026quot;. The simulated populations are analyzed and discarded to save diskspace. ... ...  to get a list of available simulation models.\nIf you cannot find a simulation model that fits your need, please write to the varianttools-user mailing list and check if others have performed similar simulations using VST. You could also write to me directly for potential collaboration on simulation part of your study.\nStep 2: Learn the details of a simulation model A simulation specification file can define multiple simulation models. Command vtools show simulation SPECFILE lists all simulation models defined in SPECFILE and their descriptions, include parameters they accept.\n% vtools show simulation Peng2014_ex1 Simulations of DNA sequences in specified regions using different simulation methods, for the first example in paper \u0026quot;Reproducible Simulations of realistic samples for next-gen sequencing studies using Variant Simulation Tools\u0026quot;.

For each simulation, a file cache/MODEL_SEED.cfg will be created as the input file for the execution of the simulation pipeline. You can, however, use the --seed option to specify the seed of the simulation to reproduce a previous simulation.\nFor reproducibility reasons, all simulated datasets provided my VST will be simulated with seeds 1, 2, 3, \u0026hellip;.\nThe vtools simulate command by default only simulates one replicate of the simulation. It will repeat itself a number of times if option --replicates is specified. SEED, SEED+1, SEED+2 etc will be used as seed for subsequent simulations.\nIf you need to run multiple instances of VST at the same time, please use separate directories for different instances of the vtools simulate command.\nSpecification of regions (option --regions) Because VST simulates true genomic regions of the human genome, a key parameter of many simulation models is --regions. You can, for example, pass a region in chr:start-end format as\n--regions chr17:540000-570000  or multiple regions as\n--regions chr17:540000-570000,20000-210000,chr20:123450-134500  Here multiple regions are separated by \u0026ldquo;,\u0026rdquo;, and chromosome name can be ignored if it is the same as the previous region.\nMore interestingly, you can use value of a field-based annotation database to specify regions. For example,\n--regions refGene.name2:BRCA1  locates all genes (isoforms) in the refGene database with common name name2 equals to BRCA1. You can specify regions for multiple genes using\n--regions refGene.name2:BRCA1,BRCA2,P53  You can use a different annotation database for this purpose. For example\n% vtools simulate MODELFILE MODEL --regions refGene_exon.name2:BRCA1,BRCA2  simulates exon regions of BRCA1 and BRCA2. Command vtools use refGene_exon will be automatically called if refGene_exon is not linked to the current project.\nThe --regions option allows the use of set operations (|, \u0026amp;, -, and ^ for union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference, respectively) to modify specified regions. For example, if you need to specify intron regions of a gene, you can use\n--regions 'refGene.name2:BRCA1 - refGene_exon.name2:BRCA1'  Another example would be to limit, for example, a penetrance model to certain chromosome regions:\n--regions 'refGene.name2:BRCA1 \u0026amp; chr17:41196312-41200000'  "

	"content": " Data Exploration and Quality Control Overview Quality control is a key step in association analysis. We may use a variety of criteria to clean our data (criteria directly from original vcf file or statistic summary we are interested in). Variants can also be subsetted based on these properties such as variant information, annotations, summary statistics, etc, which are displayed by vtools show fields.\n vtools select and vtools exclude commands implement variant and genotype level data selection and filtering. We could either focus on subsets of variants of interest (vtools select) or remove non-informative subsets of variants (vtools exclude) after such subsets are created. vtools update and vtools phenotype commands implement variant and sample level summary statistics. We could either get counts for different genotypes, functional variants (vtools update) or total/average of these counts per individual (vtools phenotype).  QC Pipeline in Brief  Variant \u0026amp; Genotype Level QC (vtools select and vtools exclude)\n remove low quality variants which do not pass the variants filter. remove low quality genotypes with low genotype quality score (GQ) remove low quality genotypes with low genotype depth of coverage (GD).   Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium Filter (vtools update)\n remove variants which does not pass Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium criterion (e.g. HWE pvalue \u0026lt; {$10^{-8}$} ).   Basic Summary Statistics on Variant Level (vtools update)\n based on variant level, we can get basic counts of different genotypes (calls, wild types, mutation types, homozygote genotypes, heterozygote genotypes, alternative alleles, etc). based on variant level, we can calculate alternative allele frequency, and subset variants by different allele frequency cutoff defined as common variants or rare variants. based on variant level, we cat get counts of different functional types of variants (synonymous, missense, nonsense, etc). based on variant level, we cat get counts of singletons and doubletons.   Basic Summary Statistics on Sample Level (vtools phenotype)\n based on individual level, we can get basic counts of different genotypes (calls, wild types, mutation types, homozygote genotypes, heterozygote genotypes, alternative alleles, etc) and calculate average counts. based on individual level, we cat get counts of different types of variants (synonymous, missense, nonsense, etc), and calculate average counts. based on individual level, we cat get counts of transitions and transversions, and calculate transitions V.S. transversions ratio (Ti/Tv ratio). based on individual level, we cat get counts of singletons and doubletons, and calculate average counts.

	"content": " Discover informative variants from a large number of variants Introduction Once you have imported? variants and samples of an exome or whole-genome sequencing project, you are typically facing a master variant table with millions of variants. Depending on the phenotypes of interest and particular research topics, you might want to filter variants for subsequent association analysis, or select variants that are more informative than others for further lab-based analysis. For example, you might be interested in\n Variants in a specific list of genes (cancer genes?) Variants are that novel (not in dbSNP and 1000 genomes project) Variants that exist only in cases but not in control, Variants that are non-synonymous, frame-shifting, predicted to be damaging, or highly conserved during evolution, Variants that are in exon regions of genes, Variants that are in particular pathways  Variant info and annotation fields Variants that satisfies these conditions can be selected from either project-specific properties (sample statistics, quality score etc) or annotation databases (dbSNP or 1000 genome project membership, gene regions etc). Required variant info and annotation fields could be prepared by\n Import? or update? variant info fields from source files, Calculate sample statistics? as variant info fields, and Download and link? project to various annotation databases.  Please refer to relevant documentation pages for details.\nSelection and management of variants After you have required variant info and annotation fields in place, you have conceptually a huge table with variant as rows and variant info and annotation fields as columns. It is then relatively easy to use command vtools select or vtools exclude to select variants of interest. For example, if you have a field num_case as number of alternative alleles in the cases (affected individuals), num_control as number of alternative alleles in controls (unaffected individuals), SIFT_score from database dbNSFP?, you could use condition\n'num_case\u0026gt;0' 'num_control=0' 'SIFT_score\u0026gt;0.95' 'dbSNP.chr is NULL'  to select variants that are available in cases (num_case\u0026gt;0), not in control (num_control=0), predicted to be damaging (SIFT_score\u0026gt;0.95), and is not in dbSNP (dbSNP.chr is NULL). The last condition looks a bit strange but it merely means that there is no value (NULL) for field dbSNP.chr in the large virtual table we have imagined, meaning variants that are not in the dbSNP database.\nSelected variants could be outputted directly but they are more frequently saved to a separate variant table for future reference. Many variant tables could be created based on different selection criteria, and you could use any of these tables whenever a variant table is needed (e.g. after commands vtools select, vtools exclude, vtools output, and vtools export).\nTutorials For more information on the use of these commands, please refer to the following tutorials:\n Analyzing 44 whole genome cases and 200 exome controls, with detailed performance measures ? Analyzing 5 whole-genome samples from Illumina ? Compare variants from the same samples called by Complete Genomics and Illumina ? Select variants belonging to specified genes ?  "

The file should be delimiter separated with format described by parameter --format. Gzipped files are acceptable. If a preprocessor is defined in the format, input files will be processed by the preprocessor before they are imported. optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit --build BUILD Build version of the reference genome (e.g. hg18) of the input data. If unspecified, it is assumed to be the primary reference genome of the project. If a reference genome that is different from the primary reference genome of the project is specified, it will become the alternative reference genome of the project. The UCSC liftover tool will be automatically called to map input coordinates between the primary and alternative reference genomes. If you are uncertain about the reference genome used in the data, use a recent standard reference genome (e.g. hg19) and validate it after the data is imported (c.f. \u0026quot;vtools admin --validate_build\u0026quot;). --format FORMAT Format of the input text file. It can be one of the variant tools supported file types such as VCF (cf. 'vtools show formats'), or a local format specification file (with extension .fmt). If unspecified, variant tools will try to guess format from file extension. Some file formats accept parameters (cf. 'vtools show format FMT') and allow you to import additional or alternative fields defined for the format. --sample_name [SAMPLE_NAME [SAMPLE_NAME ...]] Name of the samples imported by the input files. The same names will be used for all files if multiple files are imported. If unspecified, headers of the genotype columns of the last comment line (line starts with #) of the input files will be used (and thus allow different sample names for input files). If sample names are specified for input files without genotype, samples will be created without genotype. If sample names cannot be determined from input file and their is no ambiguity (only one sample is imported), a sample with NULL sample name will be created. -f, --force Import files even if the files have been imported before. This option can be used to import from updated file or continue disrupted import, but will not remove wrongfully imported variants from the master variant table. -j N, --jobs N Number of processes to import input file. Variant tools by default uses four processes to import variants and samples genotypes in parallel, and you can use more or less processes by adjusting this parameter. Due to the overhead of inter-process communication, more jobs do not automatically lead to better performance. -v {0,1,2}, --verbosity {0,1,2} Output error and warning (0), info (1) and debug (2) information to standard output (default to 1).  2. General usages and options Command vtools import imports variants, sample genotypes and related information fields. The imported variants are saved to the master variant table variant of the project, along with their information fields. Samples are saved to a genotype database $proj_genotype as separate sample tables.\n Variant tools can import SNVs, Indels and complex variants with reference and alternative alleles explicitly listed in the source files. It cannot yet handle structural variants such as large indels listed in vcf file as \u0026lt;INS\u0026gt; or DUP:TANDEM\u0026gt;. For details about how different types of variants are imported into variant tools, please refer to here.\n Although vcf files produced by different variant calling software have different fields, variant tools provides a growing number of pipelines to import data in particular formats. You can have a look at available pipelines (vtools show pipelines) and details of a particular pipeline (vtools show pipeline PIPELINE) to see if you can find a pipeline to import your data.\n It is sometimes useful to import only variants to a project. The variant info could be added later using command vtools update, or built into an annotation database to reduce the size of the project.\n   Examples:create a project and load some sample data\nLet us first create a project and download a sample project with a bunch of test datasets:\n% vtools init import --parent vt_testData INFO: variant tools 3.0.0dev : Copyright (c) 2011 - 2016 Bo Peng INFO: Please visit http://varianttools.sourceforge.net for more information.

These files (with extension .fmt) tell variant tools how to read from an input file. They are available online and will be downloaded automatically to the local resource directory of variant tools. Please refer to the variant tools input file format for a list of supported formats, or use command vtools show formats to get a list of formats, and vtools show format FMT for details of a format.\nA format specification file defines how to import variants (fields chr, pos, ref, and alt), variant info fields, genotypes, and genotype infor fields from input files. It basically tells command vtools import what fields are available from input file, from which column each field should be read, how to post-process input (e.g convert 0-based positions to 1-based), and how to store the data (data type).\nAlthough variants consists of chromosome, position, reference and alternative alleles, your input does not have to contain all such information. For example, using format rsname, variant tools can import variants from a list of dbSNP IDs.\n Examples: Show supported file formats and details of a format\nCommand vtools show formats lists all supported file formats with a short description.\n% vtools show formats INFO: Upgrading variant tools project to version 2.7.20 ANNOVAR Input format of ANNOVAR.

Because these input files do not contain reference and alternative alleles of variants, this format queries such information from the dbSNP database using chr and pos. Records that does not exist in dbSNP will be discarded. Records with multiple alternative alleles will lead to multiple records. pileup_indel Input format for samtools pileup indel caller.

The input columns could be adjust by format parameters chr_col, pos_col, ref_col, and alt_col. This format assumes a 1-based position. If the input data uses 0-based position, parameter pos_adj can be used to adjust input. \n\nIf your input file matches the description of a format, you can use this format to import data. The format should be specified by parameter --format, although this parameter could be ignored if file format can be detected automatically from file extension (e.g. format vcf will be used automatically for files with extension .vcf and .vcf.gz).\nExamples: Import variants using format basic File variants.txt has a list of variants as follows\n% head variants.txt 1 203148112 T - 1 203148168 G A 1 203148202 G C 1 203148224 G A 1 203148265 GG T 1 203148284 T C 1 203148294 G T 1 203148359 C A 1 203148360 G A 1 203148360 G C  You can import variants using format basic as follows:\n% vtools import variants.txt --format basic --build hg38 hg38.crr: 100% [==============================] 802,364,740.0 2.8M/s in 00:04:50 INFO: Importing variants from variants.txt (1/1) variants.txt: 100% [=====================================] 20 3.1K/s in 00:00:00 INFO: 20 new variants (17 SNVs, 1 insertions, 1 deletions, 1 complex variants) from 20 lines are imported.

The variants will be imported to the master variant table and there is no way to trace the origin of the variants if variants from multiple files are imported. A list of variants can be imported as a sample without genotype if a sample name is given. The variants will be imported to the master variant table. A sample will be created with these variants. You can use vtools select variant --samples CONDITION to locate variants belonging to this sample. One or more samples will be created for an input file with one or more samples. Variant tools will try to use sample names specified by parameter --sample_name, or names from header of input file. A NULL sample name will be used if no sample name could be determined.   Sample names could be changed using command vtools admin --rename_samples after they are imported. If genotypes for samples are stored in separate files (e.g. chromosome by chromosome), they will be imported as separate samples. If proper sample names are provided, samples with the same names (and belong to the same physical sample) could be merged using command vtools admin --merge_samples.    Examples: import a list variants and create a sample without genotype If there is no genotype in the input file, no sample is created by default. This is the case for the previous example where only variants are imported:\n% vtools show samples sample_name filename  However, if you would like to trace what variants have been imported from each input file, you can create a sample (without genotype information) by providing parameter --sample_name.\n% vtools init import -f % vtools import variants.txt --format basic --build hg38 --sample_name noGT INFO: Importing variants from variants.txt (1/1) variants.txt: 100% [================================================================] 20 2.2K/s in 00:00:00 INFO: 20 new variants (17 SNVs, 1 insertions, 1 deletions, 1 complex variants) from 20 lines are imported.

For example, your project might involve multiple batches of data over the years and variants from the old and new batches are processed using different versions of pipelines with different reference genome. In addition, you might want to a previous collection of samples or some public dataset as controls to your project, but they might use a different reference genome than your project. variant tools allows you to import data in two reference genomes. All you need to do is to specify the correct build of reference genome for each batch of data using option --build.\nImport datasets in hg19 and hg38 Variants from CEU.vcf.gz uses build hg18 of the reference genome,\n% vtools init import -f % vtools import CEU.vcf.gz --build hg18 INFO: Importing variants from CEU.vcf.gz (1/1) CEU.vcf.gz: 100% [================================================================] 300 13.0K/s in 00:00:00 INFO: 288 new variants (288 SNVs) from 300 lines are imported.

These variants (with missing primary coordinates) can only be retrieved and annotated through the alternative reference genome. Different variants in one reference genome might be mapped to the same variant in another (e.g. variant 90460203 and 91680930 in hg19 are both mapped to 91044656 in hg18). If two (or more) variants imported from the alternative reference genome are mapped to the same coordinates in the primary reference genome, duplicate entries will appear in the primary reference genome. If you have data in both reference genome (e.g. hg18, hg19), it is suggested that you use the more recent reference genome (e.g. hg19) as the primary reference genome, because latter reference genomes have more variants and less probability of coordinate collision.\n 2.4 Validate build of reference genome and variant positions If you are uncertain about the reference genome of your input data, or if the variant positions are 0- or 1-based, you can use command vtools admin --validate_build to compare reference alleles with the alleles at the corresponding locations on the reference genome. You will notice a large number of mismatch variants if you have used incorrect reference genome or failed to adjust positions of variants from 0-based positions to 1-based.\nExamples: validate if the correct reference genome has been specified\nLet us import variants from variants.txt using hg18,\n% vtools init import -f % vtools import variants.txt --format basic --build hg18 % vtools admin --validate_build Validate reference alleles: 100% [=========================] 20/13 2.3K/s in 00:00:00 INFO: 19 non-insertion variants are checked. 13 mismatch variants found.  13 out of 19 non-insertion variants mismatch so we let us try using the hg19 build of reference genome,\n% vtools init import -f % vtools import variants.txt --format basic --build hg19 % vtools admin --validate_build Validate reference alleles: 100% [=========================] 20/1 976.6/s in 00:00:00 INFO: 19 non-insertion variants are checked. 1 mismatch variants found.  We still have 1 mismatch variant but the variants are more likely created using hg19. The mismatch variants can be found in the project log file, or be listed with option -v2. It should be verified or removed from the project. \n2.5 Performance optimization (option --jobs and other techniques) variant tools by default uses multiple processes to load data (--jobs 4), which works well for most datasets under most computing environments. Compared to importing data using a single process (--jobs 1), it performs slightly worse for small datasets, but is significantly faster for large files, especially when multiple files are imported. If you have high speed harddrive (e.g. disk array, SSD), you can use more processes to import data although more processes do not automatically translate to better performance due to the overhead of multi-processing and disk I/O scheduling.\nDepending on your computing environment (amount of RAM, speed of harddrive), vtools import could be optimized by setting appropriate runtime options that are compatible with your computer hardware environment. One optimization is to temporarily set an in-ram journal mode, and in-ram cache if the computer has large RAM:\n% vtools admin --set_runtime_option 'sqlite_pragma=synchronous=OFF,journal_mode=MEMORY,cachesize=10000'  The in-ram journal mode will lessen the disk I/O burden, but compromises the database\u0026rsquo;s failure recovery capability. It is therefore recommended to revert the setting after the import is done.\nAnother optimization is to move the temporary directory to a large, separate physical disk. By default the temporary directory locates in one of the system\u0026rsquo;s temporary folders (e.g., /tmp or /var/tmp for Linux). \u0026ldquo;\u0026lsquo;Moving $temp_dir to a different physical disk will greatly improve the performance of vtools import (and vtools associate) because of significantly less movement of reading head of harddrives.\n% vtools admin --set_runtime_option 'temp_dir=/home/HD1/tmp_some_random_name'  The folder\u0026rsquo;s name is arbitrary. It will be created each time a command starts and deleted upon completion of the command. It is very important to make sure that for import and associate commands there is sufficient disk space in the temporary directory, since potentially large temp files will be generated by these commands.\n After data import is finished, we will set journal_mode back to default, for reasons previously discussed.\n% vtools admin --reset_runtime_option sqlite_pragma  Finally, if you need to import a large amount of data from multiple files, it can be helpful to create multiple project, import files one by one (or group by group), and create a parent project from these children projects.\n[This tutorial][4] demonstrates how to import all genotype data from the 1000 genomes project using different techniques. It contains some tips on how to import a large amount of data (the uncompressed 1000 genome data exceed 1 Tb).\n 3. Importing data in particular formats 3.1 Importing VCF files (format vcf) VCF is the most commonly used format to store genetic variants and sample genotypes from next-gen sequencing studies. variant tools can import data from plain (.vcf) or compressed (.vcf.gz) vcf format (version 4.0 or higher). Depending on the number of samples a vcf file stores, variant tools can import only variants (even if the vcf file contains sample genotypes, see an example below), import variants with a sample without genotype, and import all samples in a vcf file using specified sample names or sample names obtained from the meta information (see examples above). A limitation is that variant tools ignores phase information of genotypes.\nImport variant and genotype info fields The vcf format can store arbitary variant and genotype information fields. variant tools by default does not import any variant and info fields. However, the default configuration file does provide a variant info field DP and a genotype info field DP_geno, which you may import using option --var_info and --geno_info. To import variant or genotype fields from a vcf file, you need to\n know what fields are available from the input vcf file. That is to say, you need to open a file, read its header, and determine what fields are provided. use command vtools show format vcf to see what fields are available. If the field you would like to import is listed, you can add it to parameter --var_info or --geno_info to import it. Otherwise, you can customize your format file? to add the field. use command vtools import input_file.vcf --var_info var_fields --geno_info geno_fields to import variants, genotypes and related fields.   If your vcf file is bgzipped and tabix indexed (you can run compress and index your vcf file using commands bgzip and tabix), you can use command vtools show track FILENAME.vcf.gz to get details of the vcf file. The [track][5] function can also be used to retrieve such information when needed so you do not have to import variant info fields into the project.\n If your vcf file contains novel variant and/or geno info fields, or if you would like to import all variant and genotype info fields into the project, you can create a customized .fmt file to import these. This process can be simplied using pipeline [import_vcf][6][?][6]. The command to use is similar to vtools execute import_vcf --input my_file.vcf --output myvcf.fmt --build hg19.\n   Examples: importing variant and genotype info fields If we have a look at the header of CEU.vcf.gz, we can see\n% gzcat CEU.vcf.gz | head -14 ##fileformat=VCFv4.0 ##INFO=\u0026lt;ID=DP,Number=1,Type=Integer,Description=\u0026quot;Total Depth\u0026quot;\u0026gt; ##INFO=\u0026lt;ID=HM2,Number=0,Type=Flag,Description=\u0026quot;HapMap2 membership\u0026quot;\u0026gt; ##INFO=\u0026lt;ID=HM3,Number=0,Type=Flag,Description=\u0026quot;HapMap3 membership\u0026quot;\u0026gt; ##INFO=\u0026lt;ID=AA,Number=1,Type=String,Description=\u0026quot;Ancestral Allele, ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/pilot_data/technical/reference/ancestral_alignments/README\u0026quot;\u0026gt; ##reference=human_b36_both.fasta ##FORMAT=\u0026lt;ID=GT,Number=1,Type=String,Description=\u0026quot;Genotype\u0026quot;\u0026gt; ##FORMAT=\u0026lt;ID=DP,Number=1,Type=Integer,Description=\u0026quot;Read Depth\u0026quot;\u0026gt; ##FORMAT=\u0026lt;ID=CB,Number=1,Type=String,Description=\u0026quot;Called by S(Sanger), M(UMich), B(BI)\u0026quot;\u0026gt; ##rsIDs=dbSNP b129 mapped to NCBI 36.3, August 10, 2009 ##INFO=\u0026lt;ID=AC,Number=.,Type=Integer,Description=\u0026quot;Allele count in genotypes\u0026quot;\u0026gt; ##INFO=\u0026lt;ID=AN,Number=1,Type=Integer,Description=\u0026quot;Total number of alleles in called genotypes\u0026quot;\u0026gt; #CHROM POS ID REF ALT QUAL FILTER INFO FORMAT NA06985 NA06986 NA06994 NA07000 NA07037 NA07051 NA07346 NA07347 NA07357 NA10847 NA10851 NA11829 NA11830 NA11831 NA11832 NA11840 NA11881 NA11894 NA11918 NA11919 NA11920 NA11931 NA11992 NA11993 NA11994 NA11995 NA12003 NA12004 NA12005 NA12006 NA12043 NA12044 NA12045 NA12144 NA12154 NA12155 NA12156 NA12234 NA12249 NA12287 NA12414 NA12489 NA12716 NA12717 NA12749 NA12750 NA12751 NA12760 NA12761 NA12762 NA12763 NA12776 NA12812 NA12813 NA12814 NA12815 NA12828 NA12872 NA12873 NA12874 1 533 .

However, it is not always clear whether a field should be imported as variant info or genotype info field.

If variant info DP lists the total depth of the genotype of all samples, it should be imported as --var_info DP. If DP appear in the FORMAT column, it should be imported using field DP_geno and used as --geno_info DP_geno.

For example, the --geno option accepts a genotype field. The default GT field import all genotypes assuming that GT is the first field in the genotype columns. However,\n You can use option --geno without value to specify an empty genotype field so that variant tools will not process any genotype. In vcf.fmt we import wild-type genotypes as numeric value 0. This is important for the purpose of association studies. If you are only interested in exploring variants of your sample, and you do not care to discriminate wild-type genotypes from missing genotype calls, you may set --wildtype_value None, which will leave out all wild-type genotypes, resulting in much quicker import and smaller database size. The GT field assumes that GT is the first field in the FORMAT column. However, some variant-calling software produce non-standard vcf files that do not follow this standard. In this case, an alternative field safe_GT can be used (e.g. --geno safe_GT) to import genotypes according to the location of GT in the FORMAT string.

Due to the flexibility of the format specification system, it can import variants and genotypes from data that have non-standard (e.g. 0-based index), unclear or even missing information on fields chr, pos, ref, and alt. For example, variant tools can import variants with just rsname by querying the dbSNP database for variant information, and variants with only observed slleles by querying the reference genome for reference and alternative alleles. Please check here for a list of supported file formats. If you cannot find a format that fits your need, you can write a format description file by yourself. We can assist you in this process if you could send us a sample data file.\n"

(default: 4)  Model This example simulates a miniature exome sequencing study with variants in the exon regions of 20 genes (isoforms) in the G Protein Coupled Receptors signaling pathway. These genes reside on chromosomes 6, 8, and 10 and chromosome X. The simulated regions overlap with 27 isoforms of 15 genes in the NCBI reference sequences database [Pruitt, et al. 2007]. The coding regions of these genes range from 563 to 1818 base pairs and represents 16.2% of the total simulated region (17,841 of 110,387 bp).\nThe demographic model starts with an ancestral population of 7,300 individuals and evolves for 100,000 generations, following a Settlement of New World model that models the evolution of Africa, Asian, Mexican, and European populations and the formation of the Mexican American population [Gutenkunst, et al. 2009]. The evolutionary process was subject to the influence of a K80 nucleotide mutation model [Kimura 1980] with a mutation rate of 1.8 × 10–8 and a transition transversion ratio of 2, a fine-scale recombination with hotspot model with average recombination rate (per region) ranging from 6.14 × 10–9 to 6.23 × 10–6, and a natural selection model with selection coefficients of 0.0001, 0.0001, and 0.001 for missense, stoploss, and stopgain mutations, respectively. Part of the evolutionary process (80,000 of the 91,200 generation burn-in stage) was shared among replicate simulations by starting the simulations from a saved population. A scaling factor of 4 was used to speed up the simulations.\nA genetic disease caused by non-synonymous mutations in four of the 15 simulated genes is simulated. Under this penetrance model, an individual who carries a missense, stoploss, and stopgain mutation has probabilities of 0.001, 0.001, and 0.01, respectively, to be affected. Individuals will have higher probabilities to be affected if they carry more than one mutation (a multiplicative model is used) and a probability of 0.0001 if they carry no non-synonymous mutation. We drew 1000 and 2000 cases and matching numbers of controls from the simulated populations of size 151,521 using three models. The first model drew cases and controls from the same European population; the second model drew cases and controls from the Mexican American population, which is admixed from the Mexican and European populations; and the third model drew cases from the Asian population and controls from the European population. We applied a burden test proposed by Morris and Zeggini [2010] to each of the simulated datasets, first to all variants, then to only non-synonymous, stopgain, and stoploss variants identified by snpEff [Cingolani, et al. 2012]. Five genes were excluded from the latter analysis because of small numbers of non-synonymous mutations in these genes.\nResults Attach:fig2.png\nAttach:fig2a.png\nThe following figures plot the box-and-whisker plots of negative log10 p-values for association analyses between disease status and all variants (figure a) or all non-synonymous mutations (Figure b) using 1000 (bottom) or 2000 (top) cases and matching numbers of controls. In contrast to the European and Mexican American simulations, which had reasonable false-positive rates (approximately 5% for significance level 0.05) for non-causing genes, analyses of the mismatch simulations yielded high proportions of spurious associations between all genes and disease status. This signifies the importance of using ethnicity-matched samples for case-control association analysis and the danger of using public controls (e.g., data from the 1000 Genomes Project) for association analysis. Because the disease is caused by non-synonymous mutations in the causal genes, limiting association tests to such variants is predictably more powerful than tests based on all variants. It is interesting, however, that association tests using an admixed population are more powerful than tests using all European samples. The reasons behind this phenomenon require further investigation of the distribution of causal variants in the simulated populations.\n"

Note that the fields should exist for all samples that are tested. Association tests: -m METHODS [METHODS ...], --methods METHODS [METHODS ...] Method of one or more association tests. Parameters for each method should be specified together as a quoted long argument (e.g. --methods \u0026quot;m --alternative 2\u0026quot; \u0026quot;m1 --permute 1000\u0026quot;), although the common method parameters can be specified separately, as long as they do not conflict with command arguments. (e.g. --methods m1 m2 -p 1000 is equivalent to --methods \u0026quot;m1 -p 1000\u0026quot; \u0026quot;m2 -p 1000\u0026quot;.). You can use command 'vtools show tests' for a list of association tests, and 'vtools show test TST' for details about a test.

	"content": " Supported import/update/export file formats variant tools uses file format specification files (.fmt) files to describe file formats so that commands such as vtools import, vtools update and vtools export know how to import data from and export data to files in such formats.\n variant tools can import variants, variant info fields, genotypes, and genotype info fields from a file. The file must contain information about variants (chr, pos, ref, alt), although variant tools is able to obtain information from other sources if some of the variant info fields are missing. (For example, variant tools can retrieve reference alleles from a reference genome). variant tools can update variant info fields and genotype info fields for existing variants and genotypes. The file can be variant-based (contains chr, pos, ref and alt), position-based (contains chra and pos), and range-based (contains chr, starting and ending positions). In the latter cases, a record in the input file can update multiple variants at the specified location or range. variant tools can export variants, variant info fields, genotypes, and genotype info fields to a file. The format description file must define columns, which specify what and in which format to export to each column of the output file.  variant tools can import and export data in the following formats. We try to update descriptions of these formats as soon as possible but please use commands such as\n% vtools show formats % vtools show format basic\nto get the most updated information about these formats.\n| Name | Import | Update | Export | Comment | || | basic? | Y | | Y | Import variants in tab-delimited format, export variants and optional variant info fields and genotypes | | VCF | Y | Y | Y | Variant Call Format (VCF version 4.0 and 4.1) | | CSV? | Y | | Y | csv format | | ANNOVAR? | | | Y | Format of ANNOVAR input file. | | ANNOVAR_variant_function? | Y | | | used to imported annotations from ANNOVAR *.variant_function files. | | ANNOVAR_exonic_variant_function? | Y | | | imports annotations from files generated from ANNOVAR of the form *.exonic_variant_function. | | CASAVA18_snps? | Y | | | Illumina snps.txt format | | CASAVA18_indels? | Y | | | indels.txt from Illumina | | CGA? | Y | | | Complete Genomics CGA masterVarBeta$ID.tsv.bz2 file | | Pileup_indel? | Y | | | Pileup Indel format | | MAP? | Y | | | Import variants from files with only chr and pos information. reference and alternative alleles are retrieved from dbSNP. | | PLINK? | Y | Y | | Import variants and sample genotypes from PLINK file format.

	"content": " Annotating variants using multiple annotation databases, a tutorial Getting annotation databases This tutorial demonstrates how to use various databases to annotate variants in a variant tools project. These databases will be automatically downloaded and saved in directory ~/.variant_tools when they are used in a project. The amount of time required to download these databases depends on the speed of your internet connection, server load, and size of the databases. If you do no want to wait for the downloads and if you have enough disk space, you can download all variant tools resources into your local resource directory using the following commands:\n% wget --mirror http://vtools.houstonbioinformatics.org % rm -rf ~/.variant_tools # remove existing directory if exists % mv vtools.houstonbioinformatics.org ~/.variant_tools  The amount of data to download is 29G as of October 2012, and is expected to grow over time. The --mirror option allows command wget to get all files recursively, skipping files that exist locally.\nDownload a snapshot project with some variants Let us create a project and download a snapshot project called vt_quickStartGuide.\n% vtools init anno INFO: variant tools 2.0.0 : Copyright (c) 2011 - 2012 Bo Peng INFO: San Lucas FA, Wang G, Scheet P, Peng B (2012) Bioinformatics 28(3):421-422 INFO: Please visit http://varianttools.sourceforge.net for more information.

To add a gene-based annotation source such as ccdsGene to your project, the following command will accomplish this. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t already downloaded this annotation database with this or another project, vtools will automatically download the database and associate ccdsGene annotations to your project.\n% vtools use ccdsGene  What genes do my variants belong to? There are several annotation sources that could be used to annotate your variants to gene transcripts. Some examples include refGene, knownGene and ccdsGene. To get more details of these databases use vtools show annotation ccdsGene -v2 (or a similar command with refGene or knownGene) as described previously. This command downloads the ccdsGene data source allowing variants to be annotated to transcripts.\nWhat about the exon? Gene-based annotation sources such as ccdsGene, refGene and knownGene have corresponding annotation sources that are exon-based: ccdsGene_exon, refGene_exon and knownGene_exon respectively (provided indirectly through the UCSC Genome Browser database). These exon-based annotation sources contain exon start and end coordinates that are used in lieu of gene start and end coordinates for linking the annotations to your variants.\n% vtools use ccdsGene_exon  What pathways do my variants belong to?

	"content": " Annotation utility pipelines Usage % vtools show pipeline anno_utils This file defines a number of pipelines to manipulate variant tools annotation databases. Available pipelines: annFileFromText, annFileFromVcf, annoDB2proj, proj2annoDB Pipeline \u0026quot;annFileFromText\u0026quot;: This pipeline reads a tab, comma or space delimited file, take its header as name of fields, guess the type of each column, and output an .ann file with these fields. The annotation database is assumed to be of type \u0026quot;field\u0026quot; and use the first column as the linked field. The input file of this pipeline should be the text file, and the ouput file should be an .ann file. If the .ann file is created correctly, it can be used to create an annotation database from the input text file. annFileFromText_10: Create a feild description file from input text file. annFileFromText_20: Create an annotation file from fields guessed from input file Pipeline \u0026quot;annFileFromVcf\u0026quot;: This pipeline reads the header of a vcf file and creates an .ann file with chr, pos, ref, alt, and fields from all INFO fields. The input file can be a file (.vcf or .vcf.gz) or a URL (.vcf.gz only). The file must be tabix-indexed if it is bgzipped. The output file is an .ann file, which can be used to create an annotation database for the vcf file. This pipeline tries to guess the reference genome used from the VCF file but you should always check if the correct reference genome is generated. annFileFromVcf_10: Create a feild description file from input text file. annFileFromVcf_20: Create an annotation file from fields guessed from input vcf file Pipeline \u0026quot;annoDB2proj\u0026quot;: This pipeline creates a variant tools project from a variant-based annotation database. The input of this pipeline should be the .DB or .DB.gz file of an annotation database. The output should be name of a directory within which the project will be created. The output directory will be created if it does not exist. Any existing project in that directory will be removed. annoDB2proj_0: Check the existence of command sqlite3, which is required for this pipeline annoDB2proj_10: Decompress .DB.gz file if needed annoDB2proj_20: Dump the structure of the the variant table to cache/$PROJ.schema. annoDB2proj_25: Determine build information for the annotation database annoDB2proj_30: Create a .fmt file for variants in annotation database annoDB2proj_40: Create an input format definition file .fmt annoDB2proj_50: Dump the annotation database to a text file annoDB2proj_60: Create a project if it does not exist annoDB2proj_70: Create a project and import data Pipeline \u0026quot;proj2annoDB\u0026quot;: This pipeline creates an annotation database using variants and variant info fields of a variant tools project. The database can then be used, for example, to filter variants from another project. The input of this pipeline should be a vtools project database ($name.proj), the output is a .ann file ($name.ann). $name.ann, $name.DB and $name.DB.gz will be created. If a variant table is specified through parameter -export, only variants in specified variant table will be dumped. proj2annoDB_0: Check the existence of command sqlite3, which is required for this pipeline proj2annoDB_10: Dump the structure of the the variant table to cache/$PROJ.schema. proj2annoDB_11: Convert .schema to .ann definitions proj2annoDB_20: Create an annotation definition file (.ann) proj2annoDB_30: Dump the variant table to a text file proj2annoDB_40: Create annotation database from dumped text file Pipeline parameters: export A variant table to create annotation database from for pipeline proj2annoDB (default: variant)  Details Converting a project to an annotation database (pipeline proj2annoDB) You might have several projects and would like to use them to analyze a new project. For example, you might want to exclude from a project all variants that exist in a few control project (or projects with normal unaffected samples). You could achieve this by merging all these projects and analyze all variants together, but a more convenient way is to build annotation databases from these project and use them in the new project.\nThe proj2annoDB pipeline defined in anno_utils.pipeline can be used for this purpose. It exports all variants and variant info fields of the master variant table, or a specified variant table (parameter --export to a file and create an annotation database using a generated .ann file.\n Create an annotation database from a project\n% vtools init test % vtools admin --load_snapshot vt_quickStartGuide % vtools execute anno_utils proj2annoDB --input test.proj --output myanno.ann INFO: Executing step proj2annoDB_0 of pipeline anno_utils: Check the existence of command sqlite3, which is required for this pipeline INFO: Command sqlite3 is located.

Always check the .ann file before you create an annotation database from it.\nCreate an annotation specification file (.ann file) from a text file (pipeline annFileFromText) During the analysis of dataset, you might have some summary report that can be used to direct further analysis, or you might have a text file that annotate some or all fields of your project. This pipeline help you convert these files to an annotation database so that you can use it in the project.\n Create an annotation database from summary statistics outputted from command vtools output For example, the following command counts the number of variants (in a variant table called kg, across all samples) and output know gene ID and the counts to a text file.\n% vtools output kg knownGene.name 'sum(variant.num)' --group_by knownGene.name --header \u0026gt; kg.count  The text file looks like this\n% head -5 kg.count knownGene name sum variant num uc001abt.4 5 uc001abv.1 18 uc001abw.1 32 uc001abx.1 16  If you have a project with all affected samples and would like to identify novel variants that are causing the disease, you might want to remove variants that are very rare in the sample. However, doing so might not be wise because different variants in a gene might have the same effect and each of them is rare. In this case, you might want to remove all variants that appear only once (or very few times) in a gene. The information you obtained in the output of the above command can be useful.\nHowever, you will need to import the genotype counts into the project before you can use it. Because the text file contains annotation information for field knownGene.name, it is best to create an field-based annotation database that annotate this field.

The reason is that this query is identifying variants in your specified pathway and then it generates a report of these variants with all the pathways that they might be in. Genes often belong to multiple pathways. You can filter the output again, or output only the variant information (chromosome, position) if you would like to get a list of unique variants.\n"

	"content": " Generate and check with MD5 checksum for files and directories ChangeLog  Apr. 19, 2013: Minor error message improvement. Mar. 20, 2013: Version 1.0.1 with format change to handle non-ASCII filenames. February, 2013: Initial public release of version 1.0.  Download  Source code: md5sumd? (use python or python3 to run it) Windows executable: md5sumd.exe? MacOSX executable: md5sumd_macosx.zip? (decompress to get a binary file)  NOTE: If you have a filesystem with non-ASCII filenames encoded not in UTF-8, the directory md5sum might not work across platform unless you use the Python 3 version of the script (use python3 on source code). There is no binary distribution for the Python3 version due to packaging difficulties.\nRational When we transfer or backup a large number of files, it is difficult to verify if the files have been copied correctly. Although it is possible to compare files and directories with original source using dedicated file/directory comparison tools, or commands such as rsync -acv, the source data is not always available and it can be very slow to compare two large directories.\nThis script tries to address this problem by extending the standard md5sum program to allow it to handle directories, and produce partial checksum during the handling of large files. The MD5 checksum of the directory is generated by calculating the MD5 checksum of all files and subdirectories, and generate a checksum from a manifest file from these values. Entries in the manifest file are sorted so that the order at which files are processed does not affect the directory checksum. Because the manifest file contains file size information, the choice to calculate MD5 checksum based only on 1G of data (not necessarily the first 1G) of large files should be safe.\nIf you are extremely impatient, you can skip the rest of this page and use command\n% md5sumd * -v | gzip \u0026gt; .manifest.md5.gz  to generate a fingerprint for all files under a directory and save it to file .manifest.md5.gz, and use command\n% md5sumd -c .manifest.md5.gz  to check if the content of the directory has been altered during file transferring, system failure, or unintentional changes.\nUsage % md5sumd -h usage: md5sumd [-h] [--version] [-c [CHECKSUM]] [-v] [FILE_OR_DIR [FILE_OR_DIR ...]] A tool that calculates the MD5 checksum of files and directories, and use it to check the integrity of these files and directories. It has a interface that is similar to the md5sum command, with support for checksum of directories. positional arguments: FILE_OR_DIR Calculate MD5 signature of one or more files and directories and print MD5 checksums to the standard output. optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit --version show program's version number and exit -c [CHECKSUM], --check [CHECKSUM] Check the content of one or more files and directories using a file that contains the checksum of these files and directories. Gippped checksum file is acceptable. If a file is unspecified or is -, read from the standard input. -v, --verbose If specified, this program will output checksum for all files when the checksum of a directory is calculated. Such information will help the --check command to figure out what files have been changed if a directory checksum mismatch happens. This option will also enable a progress bar for file scanning.  Details Comparing two directories Let us calculate the MD5 of a directory:\n% md5sumd vtools b93f839744cd53fb87981c8254cc7511 vtools  If we copy the directory to somewhere else, we can see the signature is still the same\n% cp -r vtools ~/Temp % md5sumd ~/Temp/vtools b93f839744cd53fb87981c8254cc7511 ~/Temp/vtools/  If we change anything in that directory, the signature will be different\n% rm ~/Temp/vtools/*.pyc % md5sumd ~/Temp/vtools c71b7236b19feb1682f1c7039e5df8f2 ~/Temp/vtools/  Use directory md5 checksum to validate directory content Now let us save the md5 checksum to a file,\n% md5sumd vtools \u0026gt; vtools.md5 % md5sumd -c vtools.md5 vtools: OK  When we transfer the directory to another place, we can still use this command to validate its content as long as the directory name is not changed. Now, if we change the directory, and check again,\n% rm -rf vtools/cache % md5sumd --check vtools.md5 vtools: FAILED  Getting detailed information about directory changes. It can be frustrating when a directory checksum mismatch happens but you have no idea what has been changed. An interesting feature of the md5sumd command is that it can generate and output detailed file-level MD5 information and use it to figure out what exactly have been changed to a directory.\n% md5sumd vtools -v \u0026gt; vtools.md5 Scanning 34366 files: 100%[====================================] 2,095,623,045 48.6M/s in 00:00:430  As you can see, the --verbose option even enables a progress bar, which can be helpful for directories that contain a large number of files.

This is useful when the checksum file gets large when the --verbose option is used to list checksums of all files and directories under a large directory. For example, you can generate a checksum file using command\n% md5sumd vtools gsl -v | gzip \u0026gt; checksum.gz  and check it directory using command\n% md5sumd --check checksum.gz  Check md5 checksum read from standard input The md5sumd --check command will read from standard input if no filename (python 2.7 or higher) or a filename with name - is specified. For example,\n% md5sumd vtools gsl | md5sumd -c - vtools: OK gsl: OK  Note that md5sumd -c - does not accept gzipped stream directly so if you have a gzipped manifest, you will need to pipe it through gzip -d before it is sent to the md5sumd -c - command.\n"

With variant tools you can use the dbNSFP database or dbNSFP-light (a version with fewer features) - see which features are offered for each database version below.\ndbNSFP There can be frequent changes of name and their meanings of the fields across versions. Please pay close attention to the comments of fields before you use them.\nFor the latest version dbNSFP 2.4\n For SIFT_score, lower score means more damaging. For Polyphen2 scores, higher score means more damaging. There are multiple scores in fields SIFT_score_all, SIFT_pred_all, Polyphen2_HDIV_score_all, Polyphen2_HVAR_score_all, Polyphen2_HDIV_pred_all and Polyphen2_HVAR_pred_all. If you need a score for selecting most damaging variants, use fields such as SIFT_score, SIFT_pred, Polyphen2_HDIV_score, Polyphen2_HVAR_score and Polyphen2_HVAR_pred. There can be multiple records for a variant so output of vtools output might be surprising (e.g. output score 0.4 with criterion \u0026lsquo;score \u0026gt; 0.9\u0026rsquo;).

	"content": " Association Analysis Statistical Tests for Genotype/phenotype Associations The VAT association command We will introduce the basic usage of this command without diving into each association test. For a complete demonstration of all the tests please refer to the documentation for VAT (on the sidebar of this webpage).\nGetting started The general interface of vtools associate is as follows\n% vtools associate -h usage: vtools associate [-h] [--covariates [COVARIATES [COVARIATES ...]]] [--var_info [VAR_INFO [VAR_INFO ...]]] [--geno_info [GENO_INFO [GENO_INFO ...]]] [-m METHODS [METHODS ...]] [-g [GROUP_BY [GROUP_BY ...]]] [-s [COND [COND ...]]] [--genotypes [COND [COND ...]]] [--discard_samples [EXPR [EXPR ...]]] [--discard_variants [EXPR [EXPR ...]]] [--to_db annoDB] [-f] [-j N] [-v {0,1,2}] variants phenotypes Call one or more statistical association tests and return test results as fields to variants tested. optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit -j N, --jobs N Number of processes to carry out association tests. -v {0,1,2}, --verbosity {0,1,2} Output error and warning (0), info (1) and debug (2) information to standard output (default to 1). Genotype, phenotype, and covariates: variants Table of variants to be tested. phenotypes A list of phenotypes that will be passed to the association statistics calculator. Currently only a single phenotype is allowed. --covariates [COVARIATES [COVARIATES ...]] Optional phenotypes that will be passed to statistical tests as covariates. Values of these phenotypes should be integer or float. --var_info [VAR_INFO [VAR_INFO ...]] Optional variant information fields (e.g. minor allele frequency from 1000 genomes project) that will be passed to statistical tests. The fields could be any annotation fields of with integer or float values, including those from used annotation databases (use \u0026quot;vtools show fields\u0026quot; to see a list of usable fields). --geno_info [GENO_INFO [GENO_INFO ...]] Optional genotype fields (e.g. quality score of genotype calls, cf. \u0026quot;vtools show genotypes\u0026quot;) that will be passed to statistical tests. Note that the fields should exist for all samples that are tested. Association tests: -m METHODS [METHODS ...], --methods METHODS [METHODS ...] Method of one or more association tests. Parameters for each method should be specified together as a quoted long argument (e.g. --method \u0026quot;m --alternative 2\u0026quot; \u0026quot;m1 --permute 1000\u0026quot;), although the common method parameters can be specified separately, as long as they do not conflict with command arguments. (e.g. --method m1 m2 -p 1000 is equivalent to --method \u0026quot;m1 -p 1000\u0026quot; \u0026quot;m2 -p 1000\u0026quot;.). You can use command 'vtools show tests' for a list of association tests, and 'vtools show test TST' for details about a test. Customized association tests can be specified as mod_name.test_name where mod_name should be a Python module (system wide or in the current directory), and test_name should be a subclass of NullTest. -g [GROUP_BY [GROUP_BY ...]], --group_by [GROUP_BY [GROUP_BY ...]] Group variants by fields. If specified, variants will be separated into groups and are tested one by one. Select and filter samples and genotypes: -s [COND [COND ...]], --samples [COND [COND ...]] Limiting variants from samples that match conditions that use columns shown in command 'vtools show sample' (e.g. 'aff=1', 'filename like \u0026quot;MG%\u0026quot;'). Each line of the sample table (vtools show samples) is considered as samples. If genotype of a physical sample is scattered into multiple samples (e.g. imported chromosome by chromosome), they should be merged using command vtools admin. --genotypes [COND [COND ...]] Limiting genotypes to those matching conditions that use columns shown in command 'vtools show genotypes' (e.g. 'GQ\u0026gt;15'). Genotypes failing such conditions will be regarded as missing genotypes. --discard_samples [EXPR [EXPR ...]] Discard samples that match specified conditions within each test group (defined by parameter --group_by). Currently only expressions in the form of \u0026quot;%(NA)\u0026gt;p\u0026quot; is providedted to remove samples that have more 100*p percent of missing values. --discard_variants [EXPR [EXPR ...]] Discard variant sites based on specified conditions within each test group. Currently only expressions in the form of '%(NA)\u0026gt;p' is provided to remove variant sites that have more than 100*p percent of missing genotypes. Note that this filter will be applied after \u0026quot;--discard_samples\u0026quot; is applied, if the latter also is specified. Output of test statistics: --to_db annoDB Name of a database to which results from association tests will be written. Groups with existing results in the database will be ignored unless parameter --force is used. -f, --force Analyze all groups including those that have recorded results in the result database.  Each association test method (-m/--method) has its own commandline interface. To show all available association tests,\n% vtools show tests BurdenBt Burden test for disease traits, Morris \u0026amp; Zeggini 2009 BurdenQt Burden test for quantitative traits, Morris \u0026amp; Zeggini 2009 CFisher Fisher's exact test on collapsed variant loci, Li \u0026amp; Leal 2008 ....  To show usage of a particular test,\n% vtools show test CFisher Name: CFisher Description: Fisher's exact test on collapsed variant loci, Li \u0026amp; Leal 2008 usage: vtools associate --method CFisher [-h] [--name NAME] [-q1 MAFUPPER] [-q2 MAFLOWER] [--alternative TAILED] [--midp] [--moi {additive,dominant,recessive}] Collapsing test for case-control data (CMC test, Li \u0026amp; Leal 2008). Different from the original publication which jointly test for common/rare variants using Hotelling's t^2 method, this version of CMC will binaries rare variants (default frequency set to 0.01) within a group defined by \u0026quot;--group_by\u0026quot; and calculate p-value via Fisher's exact test. A \u0026quot;mid-p\u0026quot; option is available for one-sided test to obtain a less conservative p-value estimate. optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit --name NAME Name of the test that will be appended to names of output fields, usually used to differentiate output of different tests, or the same test with different parameters. Default set to \u0026quot;CFisher\u0026quot; -q1 MAFUPPER, --mafupper MAFUPPER Minor allele frequency upper limit. All variants having sample MAF\u0026lt;=m1 will be included in analysis. Default set to 0.01 -q2 MAFLOWER, --maflower MAFLOWER Minor allele frequency lower limit. All variants having sample MAF\u0026gt;m2 will be included in analysis. Default set to 0.0 --alternative TAILED Alternative hypothesis is one-sided (\u0026quot;1\u0026quot;) or two-sided (\u0026quot;2\u0026quot;). Default set to 1 --midp This option, if evoked, will use mid-p value correction for one-sided Fisher's exact test. --moi {additive,dominant,recessive} Mode of inheritance. Will code genotypes as 0/1/2/NA for additive mode, 0/1/NA for dominant or recessive model. Default set to additive  A basic association test requires the following input:\n variants to be analyzed (see vtools show tables) a variant table previously created for a subset of variants phenotype to be analyzed (see vtools show samples -l1) phenotype covariates to be incorporated (--covariates) samples to be analyzed (--samples) genotype quality conditions, if low quality genotypes are not previously purged from database (--genotypes) missing data filters (--discard_samples and --discard_variants) association analysis method association testing group unit (--group_by. Will perform single variant analysis if unspecified.) output database filename (--to_db) number of CPU processors to be used for parallel computing  Missing values are not allowed in phenotype/covariates data. Samples having missing values in phenotype or any covariates will be removed and you will receive a warning message. If you want to retain samples having missing values in covariates we suggest you manually fill them with specified values (vtools phenotype --set ... --samples ...). For quantitative traits the value can be the sample mean, and for qualitative traits be the most likely category.\nIn this tutorial we demonstrate basic association analysis of a disease phenotype and a quantitative phenotype (simulated traits status and bmi). We choose to include covariate phenotypes gender and age when we demonstrate the multivariate analysis.\nAssociation analysis for common variants For single variant analysis with disease trait:\n% vtools associate common status \\ --covariates gender age \\ --discard_variants \u0026quot;%(NA)\u0026gt;0.1\u0026quot; \\ --method \u0026quot;LogitRegBurden --name SNV --alternative 2\u0026quot; \\ --to_db SNV \\ -j8 \u0026gt; SNV.txt  {$p$} values calculated by this command are based on Wald statistic of logistic regression analysis. To evaluate p-values empirically,\n% vtools associate common status \\ --covariates gender age \\ --discard_variants \u0026quot;%(NA)\u0026gt;0.1\u0026quot; \\ --method \u0026quot;LogitRegBurden --name SNV_permute --alternative 2 -p 100000000 --\\ adaptive 5e-5\u0026quot; \\ --to_db SNV \\ -j8 \u0026gt; SNV_permute.txt  we use a maximum of 100 million permutations per test, with an adaptive criteria {$p=5 \\times 10^{-5}$}. It takes about 15 seconds to complete the analysis on 1711 groups analytically and about 15 minutes on the same data using permutation based p-value evaluations.\nBy setting --name (inside the --method option) to a different name SNV_permute it is possible to insert new results from permutation tests to the same database SNV.DB while keeping the results from the previous non-permutation based analysis intact.\nAssociation analysis for rare variants Instead of analyzing them individually, rare variants are usually grouped into association units and are analyzed by groups. For exome analysis association units are genes. The --group_by/-g option can be used to create flexible grouping themes for rare variant analysis from variant fields or annotation databases. For example the name2 field in the refGene database can be used to classify variants into genes for analysis:\n% vtools associate rare status \\ --covariates gender age \\ --discard_samples \u0026quot;%(NA)\u0026gt;0.1\u0026quot; \\ --discard_variants \u0026quot;%(NA)\u0026gt;0.1\u0026quot; \\ --method \u0026quot;BurdenBt --name BurdenTest --alternative 2\u0026quot; \\ --group_by name2 \\ --to_db BurdenTest \\ -j8 \u0026gt; BurdenTest.txt  Permutation based analysis and other association methods (vtools show tests for disease traits and quantitative traits) are available but will not be demonstrated here.\nResuming previously terminated analysis Exome-wide association scan typically consists of thousands of tests for gene-based analysis, and up to a million tests for single variant analysis. In many cases an association command may be interrupted before all tests are completed (e.g., commands terminated due to running out of reserved CPU time on clusters, etc). If you have used --to_db option in the previous command, then resuming the analysis is simple: just re-run the exact command that was interrupted. The program will skip the records that exist in the result database and only carry out the ones that are missing. If you want to start all over, you may apply a --force option to the association command so that the existing result database will be overwritten, regardless of the data it already contains.\nSetting a timeout for permutation based association analysis Although with the \u0026quot;adaptive permutation\u0026quot; approach most permutation tests in an exome-wide a\\ ssociation scan would terminate early after a few thousand permutations, for scans involvin\\ g up to a million association tests you are likely to see some tests running for hours, rep\\ orting very small p-values in the end. These tests will temporarily hold up the computation\\ resource (they have to be finished first before the rest of tests get started). We provide\\ an option to set a time limit per test, in addition to using the adaptive permutation. Thi\\ s option is useful particularly when your computation resource is tight, or if you use a cl\\ uster that offers limited walltime, or if your sample size is small and result in extreme v\\ alues of test statistic. To set the association timeout to 1 hour (3600s): % vtools admin --set_runtime_option association_timeout=3600 % vtools show  After association scan is complete you can track and redo these timed out tests with larger or no timeout value,\n% vtools select variant \u0026quot;test_pvalue \u0026lt; 0\u0026quot; --table TO_REDO % vtools admin --reset_runtime_option association_timeout  and re-run the association command with --force option so that the updated results will be written to the database previously generated with the --to_db option.\nReset temporary data folder for association analysis We implemented a mechanism to optimally organize and access the genotype data for association testing. Temporary association databases will be generated on the fly and removed after the analysis is complete. By default these databases will be placed in the operating system\u0026rsquo;s temp path (usually /tmp or /var/tmp on Unix-like system). We may need to specify a temporary folder for association testing that 1) has large disk space and 2) locates on a different physical harddrive than the original project database bundle. Using a small disk for the temporary data may cause program crash (in which case you will receive an error message complaining about disk space) or degraded performance (in which case you will receive a warning message). To reset the temp folder, use\n% vtools admin --set_runtime_option temp_dir=/path/to/an/empty/directory  Other runtime options for association analysis Two other runtime options associate_num_of_readers and treat_missing_as_wildtype for association testing are available but will not be discussed here. Please use the following command to see the usage of these runtime options:\n% vtools show runtime_options  Viewing and Interpreting Association Results View association analysis results (This feature is under development)\nvtools_report commands plot_qq and plot_manhattan to present the association analysis results in QQ plot or Manhattan plot:\nusage: aviewer [-h] [--version] {qq,manhattan,manhattan_plain} ... Association Viewer, generating QQ / Manhattan plots of p-values from association analysis. Input data should be in the format of the output from 'vtools associate' command and be piped to the program as stdin. positional arguments: {qq,manhattan,manhattan_plain} qq QQ plot via ggplot2 manhattan Manhattan plot via ggplot2 manhattan_plain Manhattan plot implementation not using ggplot2 optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit --version show program's version number and exit  This program generates graphs for {$p$} values, allowing for\n multiple association results plotted on the same / different pages various color, shape and legend themes to choose from text labels for siginificant p-values on the graph text labels for specified variants/genes on the graph marks for significance levels (Bonforroni correction or user specified value)  Online Dataset Examples You can use our snapshot for association vt_ExomeAssociation to test out the VAT association features.

Voight, David Altshuler, Bernie Devlin, Marju Orho-Melander, Sekar Kathiresan, Shaun M. Purcell, Kathryn Roeder and Mark J. Daly (2011) Testing for an Unusual Distribution of Rare Variants. PLoS Genetics doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1001322. http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1001322^]) for disease traits, to test for the hypothesis of rare variants disease association under the particular assumption that rare variants observed in cases and controls is a mixture of phenotypically deleterious, protective and neutral variants. Instead of using a cumulative dosage (or \u0026ldquo;burden\u0026rdquo;) based summary statistic over a gene region, it directly contrasts the observed and expected distribution of minor alleles in cases and controls at each locus as an evidence of \u0026ldquo;unusual distribution\u0026rdquo;, and combine evidences from multiple loci (whether it be an evidence of protective or deleterious) to formulate the {$C(\\alpha)$} statistic: {$$T=\\sum_{i=1}^m[(y_i-n_ip_0)^2-n_ip_0(1-p_0)]$$}\nThe original paper evaluates p-value of the test under large sample normal assumption, which usually would not hold for the real world data. Implementation in this program also allows permutation based {$C(\\alpha)$} test, if parameter -p/--permutations is set greater than 0.\nDetails Command interface vtools show test Calpha Name: Calpha Description: c-alpha test for unusual distribution of variants between cases and controls, Neale et al 2011 usage: vtools associate --method Calpha [-h] [--name NAME] [-q1 MAFUPPER] [-q2 MAFLOWER] [-p N] [--adaptive C] [--moi {additive,dominant,recessive}] c-alpha test for unusual distribution of variants between cases and controls, Neale et al 2011. It tests for deviation of variance of minor allele counts in cases/ctrls from its exception based on binomial distribution. The statistic is asymptotically normally distributed. p-value can be evaluated using either permutation or asymptotic distribution as described in Neale et al 2011, although it is recommended to use permutation to estimate a reliable p-value. Calpha test is a two-tailed test optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit --name NAME Name of the test that will be appended to names of output fields, usually used to differentiate output of different tests, or the same test with different parameters. -q1 MAFUPPER, --mafupper MAFUPPER Minor allele frequency upper limit.

Default set to 0.0 -p N, --permutations N Number of permutations --adaptive C Adaptive permutation using Edwin Wilson 95 percent confidence interval for binomial distribution. The program will compute a p-value every 1000 permutations and compare the lower bound of the 95 percent CI of p-value against \u0026quot;C\u0026quot;, and quit permutations with the p-value if it is larger than \u0026quot;C\u0026quot;.

	"content": " Create annotation database Because you write your own .ann file, please consider using pipelines in anno_utils, which can usually create .ann file from some data sources with pre-defined formats.\nDefine a new annotation database If you would like to use an annotation source that is not currently supported by variant tools, you could send us and email if the data source is publicly available, or write an annotation specification file to create your own annotation database. This file describes various aspects of an annotation database such as\n Type of annotation (variant, positional, range and field) The reference genome(s) it uses, Description of the database, including license and citation, Where to get the database and/or its source, and Fields that the annotation database will provide  An annotation file follows a windows .ini format. It is divided into several sections, each with several key=entry lines. Lines that start with a # or ; are comments and are ignored. Inline comments starts with ;. An annotation file should always starts with line\n#Variant tools schema version 1.0  An annotation file should have sections linked fields and data sources, followed by sections that describe each field.\nSection [linked fields] A database can provide one or more sets of linked fields by which it is linked to the master variant table of the project. Each line should have format\nbuild=field1,field2,...  where build is the build of a reference genome, or \u0026lsquo;*\u0026rsquo; if this annotation database can be linked to project with any referenge genome.\nOne or more fields can be specified as \u0026lsquo;linked fields\u0026rsquo;:\n for variant annotation database, they should be names of chr, pos, ref, and alt fields. for position annotation database, they should be names of chr and pos fields. for range annotation database, they should be names of chr, start pos and ending pos fields. for field annotation database, they should be names of fields that link to the master variant table.  For example, it a variant-based database provides coordinates for both hg18 and hg19, the build lines will be similar to\nhg18=chr,hg18_pos,ref,alt hg19=chr,hg19_pos,ref,alt  where chr, hg18_pos, hg19_pos, ref, alt are fields defined below.\nSection [data sources] This section can have keys\n description: description of the database encoding (optional): encoding of the input file. If you see errors such as \u0026quot;codec can't decode byte 0xe7 in position 21480\u0026quot;, you should perhaps add encoding=ISO-8859-1 to your .ann file. preprocessor (optional): A preprocessor to pre-process files before it can be imported. A common preprocessor is Dos2Unix() which converts files with \\r as newline character to unix format (with \\n as newline character. header (optional): variant tools by default treats lines with a leading # as header and skip them during data importing. The header will also be used to probe sample names for some formats (e.g. .vcf). If your input file does not use such a header, you can override this behavior by specifying the number of lines to skip (header=1), or a pattern by which headers are matched (e.g. use header=^%.* for header lines starting with %, see documents of the Python re package for details). anno_type: can be one of \u0026lsquo;variant\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;position\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;range\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;field\u0026rsquo; direct_url: URL to download annotation database directly. If no URL is given, variant tools will always build the database from source. delimiter: delimiter to define columns in the input file. Default to tab (delimiter='\\t'). If your input can be either tab or space delimited, use delimiter=None. source_type: type of source files, we currently supported tab based text file (txt) and vcf file. source_url: How to obtain source file to be imported. If variant tools fail to download the database directly, it will get the source file and try to import data from it. The source url can be  A local file. This is rarely used because a user who builds annotation from a local file usually specify it using option --files of the vtools use command. A \u0026lt;a class='urllink' href='ftp://' rel='nofollow'\u0026gt;ftp://\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; or \u0026lt;a class='urllink' href='http://' rel='nofollow'\u0026gt;http://\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; (or other) URLs (white space delimited). variant tools will try to download the file using a http client. A sql in the format of sql://user@password:select something from a database. variant tools will try to connect to a sql server using specified username and password, run the query and use the result as input source file. Only a mysql server is supported at this time.  source_pattern: pattern of source files (used to exclude README etc) version: version of the database, which is not necessarily version of the data source. The convension is sourceVersion_dbVersion. If unspecified, vtools will try to get it from filename. For example, dbNSFP-1.1_0.db will have version number 1.1_0.  Field sections Fields sections describe the fields that will be imported. Each of them can have\n index: index(es) of field, which can be\n A 1-based index of the column in the database. The value at this column of the input file will be used for this field.\n A tuple syntax with multiple indexes separated by ',', for example 5,7). A list of values at specified columns will be passed to an adjust function to produce values of the field.\n  type: can be any SQL allowed types such as \u0026ldquo;INTEGER\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;FLOAT\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;INTEGER NOT NULL\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;DECIMAL(7,6) NOT NULL\u0026rdquo;\n comment (optional) a description of the field\n adj (optional): Functions or functors to extract or modify one or more values from the field value. variant tools provides a number of functors to help the processing of different fields. For example,\n IncreaseBy(inc=1) (increase value by inc). This is usually used to adjust 0-based position to 1-based position that is used by variant tools.\n MapValue(map) (map value to another). This function is used to map input value to another one, for example, MapValue({'het': '1', 'hom': '2'}) maps value \u0026lsquo;het\u0026rsquo; to \u0026lsquo;1\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;hom\u0026rsquo; to \u0026lsquo;2\u0026rsquo;. Note that the mapped values should be strings or None.\n Nullify(val) (treat value as NULL). This is usually used to adjust input NA values to NULL in the database.\n **RemoveLeading(val)\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; (remove leading characters). This is usually used to remove leadingchrfrom inputs with chromosomes such aschr1,chr2, because \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;variant tools\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; only stores1,2@@, etc. \n ExtractField(index, sep=';', default=None) (field of a column): Split the item by sep and return the index-th field (1-based). Return default is there are less than index fields. For example, ExtractField(2, ':') extracts 20 from 10:20:30. \n Multiple functors/functions can be used sequentially. For example, ExtractValue('CEU:'), ExtractField(1, '/') extracts value 12 from YRI:20/222;CEU:12/45 (the first extractor gets 12/45, the second extractor gets 12), and ExtractValue('CEU:'), SplitField('/') extracts values 12 and 45 from YRI:20/222;CEU:12/45.\n If none of the provided extractors can be used, you can define your own function. For example, lambda x: x[6:].replace(\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;\u0026quot;) extracts 24000 from COUNT=24,000. You can also mix function with variant tools provided extractor ExtractValue(\u0026quot;COUNT=\u0026quot;), lambda x: x.replace(\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;\u0026quot;)]) to extract 24000 from values such as ASD;COUNT=24,000;MAF=0.5.\n If the return value of at least one of the fields is a tuple of more than one values (e.g. result from functor SplitField), multiple records will be generated from this line. Non-tuple values of other fields will be copied automatically. For example, if three fields have values A1, (B1,), (C1, C2), they will produce two records of A1, B1, C1 and A1, None, C2.\n If you would like to exclude certain records, you can use adj to produce invalid records that will be excluded during importing. For example, a record with None alternative allele, or a field with NOT NULL type will be ignored, or a genotype with None mutation type will be ignored.\n  Import and test Once you have written a .ann file, you can create an annotation database using command\nvtools use /path/to/file.ann  or\nvtools use /path/to/file.ann --files source_files  if you have source files available.\nOnce the database is created and used correctly, you can have a look at it using command\nvtools show annotation ANNODB -v2  to get the basic information of the annotation database, or\nvtools show table ANNODB  to display the actual data.\nPlease pay attention to invalid records and statistics of each field (e.g. missing values) to make sure the database has been created correctly.\nExamples For example\n[SIFT_pred] index=20 adj=Nullify('NA') type=VARCHAR(2) NULL comment=SIFT prediction, D(amaging) or T(olerated)  specifies a field that predicts if a variant is damaging, with value D or T.\n[HD_INFO] index=8 adj=ExtractFlag('HD') type=INTEGER comment=Marker is on high density genotyping kit (50K density or greater). The snp may have phenotype associations present in dbGaP.  specifies a field that is imported from the HD flag of column 8 with delimiter ;. This is a common format when the annotations are created from the info column of a vcf file.\n Example for a variant annotation database with multiple reference genomes: dbNSFP.ann Example for a variant annotation database created from a .vcf file thousandGenomes.ann Example for a field annotation database keggPathway.ann    "

Please contact Bo Peng (bpeng at mdanderson.org) if you have any question.  Logging and option --verbosity (-v) variant tools, by default, outputs information lines (starts with INFO and WARNING) and progress bars during the execution of commands. Additionally the information lines and detailed debug information (starts with DEBUG) are written to a project log file ($name.log). If something goes wrong, you can check this file for details. One particular feature of this file is that it saves date and time of each log message so that you can measure the performance of operations if needed.\nThe verbosity level of command line output can be controlled by option --verbosity LEVEL, where LEVEL can be\n ``: suppress all output except for warning and errors (no INFO or DEBUG) 1: display/log progress information, including progress bars on screen output (no DEBUG) 2: display/log progress and debug information.

For example,\n% vtools admin --set_runtime_option logfile_verbosity=0  will suppress any logfile output (except for warnings). \nThe verbosity level when the project is created is the default verbosity level of the project. That is to say, if you create the project using `vtools init test -v0, the subsequent vtools command will have a default verbosity level of 0.\nSave output to files Output from vtools can be saved to files via standard output redirection. The progress/warning/errors information will be displayed on screen while only the standard output will be written to files.\n Examples: direct output to files If you load a project from online and output its variants as follows:\n% vtools init simple % vtools admin --load_snapshot vt_simple % vtools output variant chr pos ref alt -v2 \u0026gt; output.txt DEBUG: DEBUG: vtools output variant chr pos ref alt -v2 DEBUG: Using temporary directory /var/folders/bm/jnrrj61x185cw6rzzsxplkd00000gn/T/tmpBzRAJy DEBUG: Opening project simple.proj DEBUG: Running query SELECT variant.chr ,variant.pos ,variant.ref ,variant.alt FROM variant ;  the output is written to file output.txt while debug information continues to be displayed and written to log file.\n% head -n 5 output.txt 1 4540 G A 1 5683 G T 1 5966 T G 1 6241 T C 1 9992 C T  \nConditions used in variant tools commands One of the key features of the command line interface of variant tools is that its use of conditions. For example, vtools select variant COND finds variants in table variant that match specified COND, vtools select --samples COND finds variants that belong to samples that match certain COND, and vtools init --parent DIR --genotypes COND copies genotypes that match specific conditions from parent project DIR to a new project.\nGenerally speaking, conditions are arbitrary SQL expressions that involves fields in the project. The syntax is described in here, but generally speaking, you need to first determine the fields that can be used, the type of fields. Generally speaking,\n vtools show fields lists all variant info and annotation fields that can be used for selecting variants. vtools show genotypes lists all fields in the genotype tables that can be used to select genotypes. vtools show samples lists all fields in the sample table that can be used to select samples.  You can then select records using expressions,\n For numeric fields (e.g. pos), you can use expressions such as pos \u0026gt; 1000, pos = 12345, and pos BETWEEN 2000 AND 3000. For character strings (e.g. chr, ref, and alt), you can use expressions such as chr = '13', length(ref) = 1, filename like 'INT%'. Here length is a function to get the length of field chr. A complete list of usable functions is available here. Operator IN is sometimes very useful. E.g. ref IN ('A', 'C'). To test if there is a value at a field, use expression such as chr IS NULL or chr IS NOT NULL.  Multiple conditions are allowed. For example \u0026quot;ref='A'\u0026quot; \u0026quot;alt='C'\u0026quot; means \u0026quot;ref='A\u0026quot; AND alt='c'\u0026quot;. If you need OR condition, you can write that explicitly, e.g. \u0026quot;ref='A\u0026quot; OR alt='c'\u0026quot;.\nFor example,\n Condition dbSNP.chr IS NOT NULLL selects variants that are in dbSNP database. This is because all records in dbSNP has value at field chr. vtools select variant --samples \u0026quot;filename LIKE 'CEU%'\u0026quot; get variants that belong to all samples with filename starting at CEU. Condition \u0026quot;((ref='A' AND alt='G') OR (ref='G' AND alt='A') OR (ref='C' AND alt='T') OR (ref='T' AND alt='C'))\u0026quot; matches all transition mutations. Condition \u0026quot;ref=\u0026lt;small\u0026gt;'\u0026quot; select all insertions, and \u0026quot;alt='\u0026lt;/small\u0026gt;\u0026quot; select all deletions, and \u0026quot;ref != \u0026lt;small\u0026gt;'\u0026quot; \u0026quot;alt != '\u0026lt;/small\u0026gt;\u0026quot; \u0026quot;length(ref)=1\u0026quot; \u0026quot;length(alt)=1\u0026quot; selects all SNVs. vtools remove genotypes \u0026quot;DP \u0026lt; 10\u0026quot; removes all genotypes with depth less than 10. vtools export ... --samples 1 export genotypes at all samples because condition 1 means TRUE for all samples.

Usage % vtools update -h usage: vtools update [-h] [--from_file FROM_FILE [FROM_FILE ...]] [--build BUILD] [--format FORMAT] [-j N] [--sample_name [SAMPLE_NAME [SAMPLE_NAME ...]]] [--set [EXPR [EXPR ...]]] [--from_stat [EXPR [EXPR ...]]] [-s [COND [COND ...]]] [--genotypes [COND [COND ...]]] [-v {0,1,2}] table Add or update fields of existing variants and genotype from other fields, statistics of genotypes and genotype info, or files that annotate variants or their locations (e.g. Read annotation from ANNOVAR output files, import additional variant or genotype fields from .vcf files). positional arguments: table variants to be updated. optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit -v {0,1,2}, --verbosity {0,1,2} Output error and warning (0), info (1) and debug (2) information to standard output (default to 1). Update from files: --from_file FROM_FILE [FROM_FILE ...] A list of files that will be used to add or update existing fields of variants. The file should be delimiter separated with format described by parameter --format. Gzipped files are acceptable. If input files contains genotype information, have been inputted before, and can be linked to the samples they created without ambiguity (e.g. single sample, or samples with detectable sample names), genotypes and their information will also be updated. --build BUILD Build version of the reference genome (e.g. hg18) of the input files, which should be the primary (used by default) or alternative (if available) reference genome of the project. An alternative reference genome will be added to the project if needed. --format FORMAT Format of the input text file. It can be one of the variant tools supported file types such as ANNOVAR_output (cf. 'vtools show formats'), or a local format specification file (with extension .fmt). Some formats accept parameters (cf. 'vtools show format FMT') and allow you to update additional or alternative fields from the input file. -j N, --jobs N Number of processes to import input file. Variant tools by default uses a single process for reading and writing, and can use one or more dedicated reader processes (jobs=2 or more) to process input files. Due to the overhead of inter-process communication, more jobs do not automatically lead to better performance. --sample_name [SAMPLE_NAME [SAMPLE_NAME ...]] Name of the samples to be updated by the input files. If unspecified, headers of the genotype columns of the last comment line (line starts with #) of the input files will be used (and thus allow different sample names for input files). Sample names will be used to identify samples to be updated. Filename will be used to uniquely identify a sample if mutliple samples with the same name exist in the project. No genotype info will be updated if samples cannot be unquely determined. Set value from existing fields: --set [EXPR [EXPR ...]] Add a new field or updating an existing field using a constant (e.g. mark=1) or an expression using other fields (e.g. freq=num/120, refgene=refGene.name). If multiple values are returned for a variant, only one of them will be used. Parameter samples could be used to limit the affected variants. In addition, special function are provided, including 'HWE_exact' (exact test of Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium) and 'Fisher_exact' (Fisher's exact test for case/ctrl association). Set fields from sample statistics: --from_stat [EXPR [EXPR ...]] One or more expressions such as meanQT=avg(QT) that aggregate genotype info (e.g. QT) of variants in all or selected samples to specified fields (e.g. meanQT). Functions sum, avg, max, and min are currently supported. In addition, special functions #(GT), #(hom), #(het), #(alt), #(other), #(missing), #(wtGT), #(mutGT), and maf(), are provided to count the number of valid genotypes (not missing), homozygote genotypes, heterozygote genotypes, alternative alleles (#(het) + 2*#(hom) + #(other)), genotypes with two different alternative alleles, missing genotypes (number of samples - #(GT)), number of non-missing wildtype genotypes (#(GT) - #(hom) - #(het) - #(other)), number of non-wildtype genotypes (#(hom) + #(het) + #(other)), and minor allele frequency. The maf() function treats chromosomes 1 to 22 as autosomes, X and Y as sex chromosomes, and other chromosomes as single-copy manifolds. It requires a phenotype named sex or gender that codes male/female by 1/2, M/F or Male/Female if maf of variants on sex chromosomes are calculated. This function by default calculates allele frequency among existing-alleles, but will treat all missing values as wild type alleles if runtime option treat_missing_as_wildtype is set to true. -s [COND [COND ...]], --samples [COND [COND ...]] Limiting variants from samples that match conditions that use columns shown in command 'vtools show sample' (e.g. 'aff=1', 'filename like \u0026quot;MG%\u0026quot;'). --genotypes [COND [COND ...]] Limiting variants from samples that match conditions that use columns shown in command 'vtools show genotypes' (e.g. 'GQ\u0026gt;15').  2. Details Command `vtools update updates variant info fields (and to a lesser extend genotype info fields) by adding more fields or updating values at existing fields. It does not add any new variant or genotype, and does not change existing variant, sample, or genotype. Using three parameters --from_file, --from_stat, and --set, variant information fields could be updated from external file, sample genotypes, and existing fields.\n  An illustration about vtools update  \n2.1 Import variant info from external files in standard formats (--from_file) Option --from_file allows command vtools update to update variant and/or genotype info fields by reading info from an external file. This process is similar to vtools import but has two major differences:\n `vtools update does not import any new variant even if the external file has more variants. `vtools update can add or update fields from position, range or field based input files. That is to say, you could update fields from input files that describes variants at particular locations or chromosomsal regions. Variants belonging to the same location or region will share the updated info.  The variant or genotype fields that will be added or updated depends on the file format (cf. vtools show formats). File formats accept parameters to specify what fields to import. For example, parameters --var_info and --geno_info can be used with format vcf to specify which variant and genotype info fields to be updated from a vcf file.\n Examples: create a project\nLet us create a directory update and import an empty project with a few test vcf files V1.vcf, V2.vcf and V3.vcf,\n% mkdir update % cd update % vtools init update % vtools admin --load_snapshot vt_testData  The project does not have any variant so we import some from these VCF files:\n% vtools import V*.vcf --build hg38 INFO: Importing variants from V1.vcf (1/3) V1.vcf: 100% [========================================================] 1,000 10.9K/s in 00:00:00 INFO: 989 new variants (989 SNVs) from 1,000 lines are imported.

This is because DP and NS describes variants in each sample so the same variants from different samples will have different depth, and sample count should probaby be added together to reflect the total sample count. That is to say, DP here should better be considered as genotype field instead of variant field.\nVariant tools is flexible enough to handle such a situation (check vtools show format vcf for details). By specifying field DP in parameter --geno_info, this field will be added as genotype info field and be processed for each sample:\n% vtools update variant --from_file V*.vcf --geno_info DP INFO: Using primary reference genome hg18 of the project.

Although variant tools has a growing number of formats, it is sometimes needed to create your own format files to import annotations.\n Examples: Update annotation for variants presented by rsnames Let us first create some data with rsname.\n% vtools use dbSNP INFO: Downloading annotation database from annoDB/dbSNP-hg18_130.ann INFO: Downloading annotation database from http://vtools.houstonbioinformatics.org/annoDB/dbSNP-hg18_130.DB.gz dbSNP-hg18_130.DB.gz: 100% [================================================] 617,049,496.0 1.3M/s in 00:08:07 INFO: Decompressing /Users/bpeng/.variant_tools/annoDB/dbSNP-hg18_130.DB.gz INFO: Using annotation DB dbSNP in project update.

Fortunately, the map? format provides such an example so we can adapt it to the following format:\n[format description] description=a format that determins chr, pos, ref, alt from rsname using a dbSNP database variant=chr,pos,ref,alt variant_info=func [DEFAULT] db_file=dbSNP.DB # # NOTE: Functor FieldFromDB(db, res, fields) matches input(s) from # columns 'index' (column 1 in this example), compare it with field # 'fields' (name), and return results 'res' (chr, start, refNCBI, # alt).

This parameter accepts expressions in the format of VAR_INFO=FUNC(GENO_INFO) where VAR_INFO is the variant information field to be added or updated, FUNC is a function or expression, and GENO_INFO is genotype or genotype info. If you are only interested in genotype statistics, some specially defined FUNC(GENO_INFO) can be used. A list of acceptable aggregating functions is available here.\n Examples: statistics of genotype info fields Each genotype in our samples has a field DP, which is the coverage depth. To assess the quality of a variant, it is useful to calculate average depth across all samples as a variant info field. The aggregating function to use is avg:\n% vtools update variant --from_stat 'avg_DP=avg(DP)' Counting variants: 100% [==================================================] 3 110.9/s in 00:00:00 INFO: Adding field avg_DP Updating variant: 100% [===============================================] 1,611 49.2K/s in 00:00:00 INFO: 1610 records are updated  Depth of genotypes across three samples are averaged and save to a new variant info field avg_DP.

Assuming a wildtype allele 0, an alternative allele 1, and an additional alternative allele 2 if exists, a sample can have genotype 0/0, 0/1, 0/2, 1\u0026frasl;1, 2\u0026frasl;2, and 1\u0026frasl;2 at a locus on an autosome. vtools update --from_stat counts such genotype for all (or selected) variants using the following special functions:\n #(GT): the total number of genotypes #(alt): number of alternative alleles (non-zero alleles 1 or 2) #(hom): number of homozygote (genotype 1\u0026frasl;1 or 2\u0026frasl;2) #(het): number of heterozygote (genotype 0/1 or 0/2) #(other): number of heterozygote with two alternative alleles (genotype 1\u0026frasl;2). #(wtGT): number of wildtype genotypes (#(GT) - #(hom) - #(het) - #(other)) #(mutGT): number of non-wildtype genotypes (#(hom) + #(het) + #(other)) #(missing): number of missing genotypes (sample size - #(GT)) maf(): minor allele frequency. The frequency is the smaller of #(alt) / #all_alleles and 1 - #(alt) / #all_alleles. The total number of alleles is determined by type of chromosome, sex of samples, and how to treat missing values. More specifically, if runtime option treat_missing_as_wildtype is set to False (default), #all_alleles is  2 * #(GT) for variants on autosomes # GT for females + #GT for males for variants on chromosome X # GT for males for variants on chromosome Y, and #(GT) for variants on other chromosomes.   If treat_missing_as_wildtype is set to true, all missing values are counted as wildtype allele so #all_alleles is * 2 * number of samples for variants on autosomes * 2 * number of males + number of females for variants on chromosome X * number of males for variants on chromosome Y * number of samples for varants on other chromosomes\nNote that genotype 1\u0026frasl;1 an 2\u0026frasl;2 are counted for different variants (0,1) and (0,2), and #(other) is counted for both variants. Therefore, #(alt) equals #(hom) X 2 + #(het) + #(other)*2.\n Examples: sample statistics Using these special functions, we can calculate many sample statistics as various variant info fields:\n% vtools update variant --from_stat 'total=#(GT)' 'num=#(alt)' 'hom=#(hom)' 'het=#(het)' 'other=#(other)' Counting variants: 100% [==================================================] 3 238.8/s in 00:00:00 INFO: Adding field num INFO: Adding field hom INFO: Adding field het INFO: Adding field other INFO: Adding field total Updating variant: 100% [===============================================] 1,611 30.9K/s in 00:00:00 INFO: 1610 records are updated  As you can see, genotypes are not available in all samples and the first five variants are all appear as heterozygotes.\n% vtools output variant chr pos ref alt total num hom het other -l5 1 4540 G A 2 2 0 2 0 1 5683 G T 1 1 0 1 0 1 5966 T G 3 3 0 3 0 1 6241 T C 2 2 0 2 0 1 9992 C T 2 2 0 2 0  You can use the maf function to calculate minor allele frequency\n% vtools update variant --from_stat 'maf=maf()' INFO: 0, 0, and 0 variants on X, Y and other non-autosome chromosomes are identifield Counting variants: 100% [============================================] 3 316.5/s in 00:00:00 INFO: Adding variant info field maf with type FLOAT Updating variant: 100% [=========================================] 1,611 45.8K/s in 00:00:00 INFO: 1611 records are updated  This case is easy because all variants are on an autosome.\n% vtools output variant chr pos ref alt total num hom het maf -l5 1 4540 G A 2 2 0 2 0.5 1 5683 G T 1 1 0 1 0.5 1 5966 T G 3 3 0 3 0.5 1 6241 T C 2 2 0 2 0.5 1 9992 C T 2 2 0 2 0.5  However, because this dataset does not record wildtype alleles, the minior allele frequencies are 0.5 if all genotypes are heterozygotes.

But we can limit calculations on subset of samples by --samples and/or --genotypes.\n Option --samples \u0026quot;[condition]\u0026quot; can be used to limit the statistics to a subset of samples, for example, all affected individuals. [condition] should be an SQL expression using one or more columns shown in vtools show samples. For example,\n aff='1' select all samples with affection status equals to 1. some_measure\u0026gt;0.95 select all samples with some_measure greater than 0.95. filename like 'MG%' select all samples from files with filename starts with \u0026ldquo;MG\u0026rdquo;. sample_name like 'CEU%' select all samples with sample name starts with \u0026ldquo;CEU\u0026rdquo;.   Option --genotypes \u0026quot;[condition]\u0026quot; can be used to limit the statistics to a subset of samples having genotypes satisfying a [condition] defined by an SQL expression using one or more columns shown in vtools show genotypes. For example,\n GT=0 select only the wildtype genotypes GQ\u0026gt;20 select variants having genotype quality greater than 20    Examples: statistics for subsets of samples and genotypes This project has three samples:\n% vtools show samples sample_name filename SAMP1 V1.vcf SAMP1 V2.vcf SAMP1 V3.vcf  Suppose two samples from files V1.vcf and V2.vcf are affected and we would like to calculate genotype count for only these two samples, we could use parameter --samples to limit our calculation:\n% vtools update variant --from_stat \u0026quot;cases_het=#(het)\u0026quot; --samples \u0026quot;filename in ('V1.vcf', 'V2.vcf')\u0026quot; INFO: 2 samples are selected Counting variants: 100% [==================================================] 2 233.5/s in 00:00:00 INFO: Adding field cases_het Updating variant: 100% [===============================================] 1,341 35.3K/s in 00:00:00 INFO: 1340 records are updated  We can also limit the statistics to genotypes that satisfy certain conditions (e.g. with high coverage):\n% vtools update variant --from_stat \u0026quot;cases_het_highDP=#(het)\u0026quot; --samples \u0026quot;filename in ('V1.vcf', 'V2.vcf')\u0026quot; --genotypes 'DP\u0026gt;15' INFO: 2 samples are selected Counting variants: 100% [===================================================] 2 80.5/s in 00:00:00 INFO: Adding field cases_het_highDP Updating variant: 100% [=================================================] 621 42.8K/s in 00:00:00 INFO: 620 records are updated % vtools output variant chr pos ref alt cases_het cases_het_highDP -l5 1 4540 G A 1 0 1 5683 G T 1 0 1 5966 T G 2 1 1 6241 T C 1 1 1 9992 C T 1 0  \n Examples: update variant info of subsets of variants If you are interested only in variants in a variant table, you could also only update statistics for variants in specified variant tables. For example, we can select all variants that belong to all three samples and creates a table in_all:\n% vtools select variant 'total=3' -t in_all Running: 1 71.8/s in 00:00:00 INFO: 511 variants selected.  Then we can add a field case_hom to count the number of homozygotes for only these variants:\n% vtools update in_all --from_stat 'case_hom=#(hom)' --samples \u0026quot;filename in ('V1.vcf', 'V2.vcf')\u0026quot; INFO: 2 samples are selected Counting variants: 100% [===================================================] 2 50.8/s in 00:00:00 INFO: Adding field case_hom Updating in_all: 100% [==================================================] 511 67.1K/s in 00:00:00 INFO: 510 records are updated % vtools output in_all chr pos ref alt case_hom -l 5 1 5966 T G 0 1 10007 G A 0 1 20723 G C 0 1 20786 G T 2 1 31705 A G 2  \n2.4 Add fields based on other variant or annotation fields (--set) Option --set evaluates expressions from existing variant info fields and assign results to a new or existing variant info field. For example, once you have calculated allele count, you could calculate allele frequency based on sample size using expression --set 'maf=m/(n*2.0)' where m is field name calculated as \u0026ldquo;m=#(alt)\u0026rdquo; and n is sample size, which might not be \u0026quot;n=#(GT)\u0026quot; if there are missing data. Note that the denominator should be n*2.0, not n*2, because SQL requires the denominator be a FLOAT type, not INTEGER.\n Examples: set fields from variant info fields We can try to calculate the allele frequency using number of aleternative alleles and number of genotypes as follows:\n% vtools update variant --set \u0026quot;maf=num/(total*2.0)\u0026quot; INFO: Adding field maf  However, because samples from this project is called individually and wildtype alleles are not recorded, there are a lot of missing data. If we assume missing data as non-recorded wildtype alleles, we should add missing data to the denominator of the expression. To do this, we need to first calculate a field for missing genotypes:\n% vtools update variant --from_stat 'missing=#(missing)' Counting variants: 100% [=====================================================================] 3 289.1/s in 00:00:00 INFO: Resetting values at existing field missing Updating variant: 100% [==================================================================] 1,611 49.5K/s in 00:00:00 INFO: 1610 records are updated  And then calculate the real allele frequency\n% vtools update variant --set \u0026quot;real_maf=num/((total+missing)*2.0)\u0026quot; INFO: Adding field real_maf  Two allele frequencies are different\n% vtools output variant chr pos ref alt num total missing maf real_maf -l5 1 4540 G A 2 2 1 0.5 0.333333333333 1 5683 G T 1 1 2 0.5 0.166666666667 1 5966 T G 3 3 0 0.5 0.5 1 6241 T C 2 2 1 0.5 0.333333333333 1 9992 C T 2 2 1 0.5 0.333333333333  \nIn addition to variant info fields, annotation fields could also be used in these expressions and set variant info fields. There is usually no such need to copy annotation fields to variant info fields though. Moreoever, because one variant might have more than one annotation value for an annotation field (e.g. a variant might belong to two isoforms of a gene), copying annotation fields to variant info fields might loss information.\n Examples: set variant info field from annotation fields\n% vtools use refGene-hg18_20110909 % vtools update variant --set refgene=refGene.name INFO: Adding field refgene Updating variant: 100% [=================================================================] 11,984 52.6K/s in 00:00:00  We can select variants that belong to a gene and output it\n% vtools select variant 'refGene is not NULL' -t in_gene Running: 0 0.0/s in 00:00:00 INFO: 144 variants selected. % vtools output in_gene chr pos ref alt refGene -l 5 1 887188 G C NM_198317 1 887427 T C NM_198317 1 889872 C G NM_198317 1 890115 G A NM_198317 1 890593 G A NM_198317  \n"

	"content": " Weighted Burden Test for Disease and Quantitative Traits Introduction This implements a collection of weighted aggregation tests. Different from plain aggregation methods? which assumes equal contribution of each locus from the genetic region under investigation, the weighted methods assigns a \u0026ldquo;weight\u0026rdquo; to each variant site such that each site differs from another by the weight they are assigned, and these weights will contribute to the aggregated \u0026ldquo;burden\u0026rdquo;, e.g., {$$X=\\sum_i^N\\omega_iX_i$$} where {$\\omega_i$}\u0026rsquo;s are the weights. The weights often reflect the relative importance of a variant in terms of its contribution to phenotype.\nThe weighting approach was first proposed by Madsen and Browning 2010[^Bo Eskerod Madsen and Sharon R. Browning (2009) A Groupwise Association Test for Rare Mutations Using a Weighted Sum Statistic. PLoS Genetics doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1000384. http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000384^] with the assumption that \u0026ldquo;rarer\u0026rdquo; variants tend to be more important (the WSS statistic?). This weighting theme is by far the most popular weights and has been adapted into a number of methods emerged later, such as Lin and Tang 2011[^Dan-Yu Lin and Zheng-Zheng Tang (2011) A General Framework for Detecting Disease Associations with Rare Variants in Sequencing Studies. The American Journal of Human Genetics doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2011.07.015. http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0002929711003090^] and Wu et al 2011[^MichaelC. Wu, Seunggeun Lee, Tianxi Cai, Yun Li, Michael Boehnke and Xihong Lin (2011) Rare-Variant Association Testing for Sequencing Data with the Sequence Kernel Association Test. The American Journal of Human Genetics doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2011.05.029. http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0002929711002229^]. Other weighting themes such as KBAC and RBT weightings have different assumptions but they are also based solely on internal information from data. Price et al 2010[^Alkes L. Price, Gregory V. Kryukov, Paul I.W. de Bakker, Shaun M. Purcell, Jeff Staples, Lee-Jen Wei and Shamil R. Sunyaev (2010) Pooled Association Tests for Rare Variants in Exon-Resequencing Studies. The American Journal of Human Genetics doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2010.04.005. http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0002929710002077^] proposed the use of \u0026ldquo;external\u0026rdquo; weights, i.e., using functional annotation sources to calculate weight for rare variants. This weighting theme can also be naturally integrated into many rare variants methods.\nImplementation of WeightedBurdenBt and WeightedBurdenQt are similar to aggregation methods? but allows the use of the following weighting themes:\n WSS? weight, based on entire sample WSS? weight, based on controls or sample with above/below average phenotype values RBT? weight KBAC? weight External weights from annotation  Permutation methods have to be used to obtain {$p$} value for WSS (control based), KBAC and RBT weighting themes.\nDetails Command interface vtools show test WeightedBurdenBt Name: WeightedBurdenBt Description: Weighted genotype burden tests for disease traits, using one or many arbitrary external weights as well as one of 4 internal weighting themes usage: vtools associate --method WeightedBurdenBt [-h] [--name NAME] [--mafupper MAFUPPER] [--alternative TAILED] [-p N] [--permute_by XY] [--adaptive C] [--extern_weight [EXTERN_WEIGHT [EXTERN_WEIGHT ...]]] [--weight {Browning_all,Browning,KBAC,RBT}] [--NA_adjust] [--moi {additive,dominant,recessive}] Weighted genotype burden tests for disease traits, using one or many arbitrary external weights as well as one of 4 internal weighting themes.

	"content": " Calling variants using BWA and GATK best practice pipeline Usage % vtools show pipeline bwa_gatk28_hg19 A pipeline to align raw reads from fastq or BAW/SAM files using BWA and GATK best practice. It uses hg19 of human reference genome and assumes paired-end reads in plain text and compressed formats. Available pipelines: align, call Pipeline \u0026quot;align\u0026quot;: Align raw reads from input files using bwa, gatk, and picard. This pipeline accepts raw input files in plain text format, SAM/BAM format, and their compressed versions (.zip, .tar.gz, .tgz, .bz2, .tbz2 etc). All input files are assumed to be raw reads from the same sample. This pipeline generates a calibrated bam file (--output), and its reduced version if an additional output file is specified. align_0: Check the version of variant tools (version 2.1.1 and above is required to execute this pipeline) align_1: Download required resources to resource directory align_10: Check existence of commands bwa, samtools and java align_11: Check the version of bwa. Version is 0.7.4 is recommended align_12: Check the version of picard. Version is 1.82 is recommended. align_13: Check the version of GATK. Version 2.8 is recommended. align_20: Check existence of class files for Picard and GATK align_30: Build bwa index for build hg19 of reference genome align_40: Build samtools index for build hg19 of reference genome align_100: Convert bam files to paired fastq files if the input is in bam/sam format. Other input files are returned untouched. align_101: Decompress all input files (.tgz2, .tar, .tar.gz, .gz, .tgz, .zip etc) to a cache directory. Uncompressed files are hard-linked to the cache directory. align_200: Check the format of the input fastq file and write an option file with option -I if the sequences are in Illumina 1.3+ format. align_201: Call bwa aln to produce .sai files align_300: Determine (guess) a read group tag and write to a .RG file. align_301: Running bwa sampe for paired end reads, using read group tag saved in a .RG file align_302: Check the proportion of aligned reads and exit if there are less than 80% of aligned reads. align_303: If in production mode, remove fastq files dumped from bam files align_400: Merge per-lane sam files into a single bam file. This step is skipped if there is only one input file. align_500: Sort merged bam file using picard SortSam align_501: If in production mode, remove decompressed fastq and individual bam files after a single bam file has been produced. align_600: Mark duplicates using picard MarkDuplicates command align_601: Remove _sorted.bam file after deduplication is completed. align_610: Index dedupped bam file using samtools align_700: Realign indels create indel realigner target align_710: Apply indel realigner target to bam file align_711: If in production mode, remove bam files before realignment steps align_800: Create base recalibrator target align_810: Apply base recalibrator target align_811: If in production mode, remove bam files before realignment steps align_900: Generated bam file with reduced reads if more than one output file is specified Pipeline \u0026quot;call\u0026quot;: Call and validate variants (SNPs and Indels) from one or more input bam files. This pipeline accepts one or more bam files as input and a vcf file as output. If multiple input files are specified, multi-sample variant calling will be performed. call_0: Check the version of variant tools (version 2.1.1 and above is required to execute this pipeline) call_10: Check existence of commands bwa, samtools and java call_13: Check the version of GATK call_20: Check existence of class files for GATK call_100: Use unified genotyper to get raw variants call_200: Recalibrate SNPs call_210: Recalibrate INDELs call_300: Apply SNP recalibration call_310: Apply INDEL recalibration Pipeline parameters: name Name of the job to be executed. All intermediate files generated from this pipeline will be saved to $CACHE_DIR/$NAME where $CACHE_DIR is the cache directory of the project. (default: bwa_gatk28_hg19) strict_prog_version Whether or not use other version of programs if the exact version does not exist. Setting it to False allows variant tools to use other versions of the programs. (default: False) production If set to True or 1, all intermediate files will be removed. The whole pipeline would need to be rerun if a different parameter or different version of external program is used. (default: False) bwa path to bwa.

You can add path to bwa and samtools to $PATH or pass full path name to options bwa=/path/to/bwa and samtools=/path/to/samtools. Paths to Picard and GATK should be passed using options gatk_path and picard_path.\nTest the environment After you installed the programs, you should running the following commands to test if everything works ok:\n# create a new project and download test data (an online snapshot) % vtools init test --parent vt_illuminaTestData % vtools execute bwa_gatk28_hg19 align --input illumina_test_seq.tar.gz --output test.bam \\ --gatk_path /path/to/gatk --picard_path /path/to/picard --strict_prog_version False  Executing the pipeline in production mode The pipeline will by default keep all intermediate files. If you restart the pipeline with different parameter or a different version of an external file, only the affected steps will be repeated. Intermediate files will be reused if available. This allows you to examine and fine-tune the pipeline to make sure it works as expected.\nBecause intermediate files can be large, an option --production true is provided to execute the pipeline in production mode. In this mode, most intermediate files will be removed after the completion of the steps that make use of them. The pipeline can resume from the right step if it is interrupted, but has to be re-executed from the beginning if a result file is removed.\n"

	"content": " dbSNP annotation databases The default version of our dbSNP annotation is currently referring to dbSNP143 (using hg38 coordinates) as shown below. However, users can also retrieve older versions of dbSNP: dbSNP141, dbSNP138, dbSNP137, dbSNP135, dbSNP132, dbSNP131, dbSNP130, dbSNP129. The 129 and 130 versions use hg18 as a reference genome, 131, 132, 135, 137, 138 and 141 use hg19 and 143 uses hg38. The archived versions can be used by a variant tools project by referring to their specific names - for example: dbSNP-hg18_129.\n dbSNP143 has many more flags and fields than previous versions. It also does not contain all variants that are defined in dbSNP141 and earlier. A dbSNP entry might match multiple variants.

This is the GMAF reported on the RefSNP and EntrezSNP pages and VariationReporter COMMON (int) RS is a common SNP. A common SNP is one that has at least one 1000Genomes population with a minor allele of frequency \u0026gt;= 1% and for which 2 or more founders contribute to that minor allele frequency.  version 141 and earlier % vtools show annotation dbSNP-hg19_141 -v2 Annotation database dbSNP (version hg19_141) Description: dbSNP version 141 Database type: variant Number of records: 58,691,269 Distinct variants: 57,577,990 Reference genome hg19: chr, start, refNCBI, alt Field: chr Type: string Missing entries: 0 Unique Entries: 25 Field: start Type: integer Comment: start position in chrom (1-based) Missing entries: 0 Unique Entries: 48,758,859 Range: 56 - 249240605 Field: end Type: integer Comment: end position in chrom (1-based). start=end means zero-length feature Missing entries: 0 Unique Entries: 48,957,633 Range: 56 - 249240605 Field: name Type: string Comment: dbSNP reference SNP identifier Missing entries: 0 Unique Entries: 58,096,504 Field: strand Type: string Comment: which DNA strand contains the observed alleles Missing entries: 0 Unique Entries: 2 Field: refNCBI Type: string Comment: Reference genomic sequence from dbSNP Missing entries: 0 Unique Entries: 164,868 Field: refUCSC Type: string Comment: Reference genomic sequence from UCSC lookup of chrom,chromStart, chromEnd Missing entries: 0 Unique Entries: 187,096 Field: observed Type: string Comment: Strand-specific observed alleles Missing entries: 0 Unique Entries: 205,862 Field: alt Type: string Comment: alternate allele on the '+' strand Missing entries: 0 Unique Entries: 30,716 Field: molType Type: string Comment: sample type, can be one of unknown, genomic or cDNA Missing entries: 0 Unique Entries: 3 Field: class Type: string Comment: Class of variant (single, in-del, het, named, mixed, insertion, deletion etc Missing entries: 0 Unique Entries: 6 Field: valid Type: string Comment: validation status, can be unknown, by-cluster, by-frequency, by-submitter, by-2hit-2allele, by-hapmap, and by-1000genomes Missing entries: 0 Unique Entries: 63 Field: avHet Type: float Comment: Average heterozygosity from all observations Missing entries: 0 Unique Entries: 39,766 Range: 0 - 0.999999 Field: avHetSE Type: float Comment: Standard error for the average heterozygosity Missing entries: 0 Unique Entries: 46,007 Range: 0 - 0.305748 Field: func Type: string Comment: Functional cetegory of the SNP (coding-synon, coding-nonsynon, intron, etc.) Missing entries: 0 Unique Entries: 648 Field: locType Type: string Comment: Type of mapping inferred from size on reference.

	"content": " Import variants and sample genotypes from PLINK format Introduction PLINK is a widely used program for analyzing genotypic data for Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS). It can be considered as standard input format for genotyping array data. An intermediate type of genetic data between genotyping arrays and exome sequencing is the exome genotyping array, or exome chip. Unlike its GWAS counterpart which focuses on relatively common variants, exome chips contain primarily non-singleton coding variants seen in existing whole genome and exome sequencing data, plus a small proportion of non-protein-altering variants such as GWAS tag SNPs, ancestry informative markers, etc. Since exome chips are essentially genotyping arrays, they are often distributed in PLINK data format. Variant tools can thus handle exome chip input and perform rare variants association analysis for exome chip samples.\nThe standard PLINK files can be a bundle of plain text files (PED \u0026amp; MAP dataset, or its transpose, TPED \u0026amp; FAM dataset), or a bundle of binary files (BED, BIM \u0026amp; FAM). PLINK provides commands to convert between text and binary formats. Since PLINK files do not specify for a variant which allele is reference and which is alternative, importing data to a variant tools project requires matching each variant to the reference sequence to determine reference and alternative alleles; complementary strand will be used when necessary. Variant tools performs the matching procedure against hg18 or hg19 reference genomes. Other reference genome builds are not supported.\nCurrently only PLINK binary format (BED, BIM \u0026amp; FAM) is valid input. You need to use PLINK to convert text to binary format if necessary.\nA variant locus will be ignored if it is not polymorphic in input data.\nFormat specification vtools show format plink Format: plink Description: Input format for PLINK dataset. Currently only PLINK binary PED file is supported (*.bed, *.bim \u0026amp; *.fam) Preprocessor: PlinkConverter($build) Columns: None defined, cannot export to this format variant: chr Chromosome pos 1-based Position of the snp ref Reference allele alt Alternative allele Genotype: GT Gentoype coded as 0 (ref ref), 1 (ref alt) and 2 (alt alt) No configurable parameter is defined for this format.  As with other vtools import formats, importing PLINK data requires specification of format file (--format) and input data. Unlike with other formats, however, input filename for PLINK binary data is the base file name without extension. For example if you have X.bed, X.bim and X.fam files then the import command should be\nvtools import /path/to/X --format plink --build hg19 --jobs $N INFO: Preprocessing files X to generate intermediate input files for import INFO: Determining major/minor allele from data Decoding X: 100% [===============================] 149,141 9.1K/s in 00:00:16 INFO: Importing variants from cache/X.plink (1/1) X.plink: 100% [========================] 162,433 49.3K/s in 00:00:03 INFO: 149,141 new variants (149,141 SNVs) from 149,142 lines are imported.

	"content": " Extract annotation from external files Usage Function track(filename, field) returns annotation information at column col (optional) in file filename, at position (chr, pos at primary or alternative reference genome) of each variant. For example, function\n% vtools output variant chr pos ref alt \u0026quot;track('1000g.vcf.gz', 'info')\u0026quot;  single quote (') should be used for string literals in SQL functions. Double quote (\u0026quot;) should be avoided although it sometimes works.\noutput the \u0026ldquo;info\u0026rdquo; column of file 1000g.vcf.gz, for variants at location chr and pos.\nThis function currently accepts four types of track files:\n Local or online bgzipped and tabix-indexed vcf files with extension .vcf.gz. bigWig files that provides dense and continuous data for a region. bigBed files with 3 required columns and 9 optional columns. Annotation tracks in BED format can be converted to this format using program bedToBigBed. Local or online indexed BAM files with extension .bam. This format does not contain \u0026lsquo;columns\u0026rsquo; as other formats do but it provides alignment information for the variants.  The allowed and default values of the second option field vary for different file formats. Generally speaking, numeric values such as 1, 2, \u0026hellip; returns the col-th column of the input data file, with the exception that `returns1(match or not) for all matched records. String values such as\u0026ldquo;chrom\u0026rdquo;,\u0026ldquo;chromStart\u0026rdquo;,\u0026ldquo;info\u0026rdquo;` return values at specified column as strings.\nDetails Display information about tracks Before you use each track, it is important to run command\n% vtools show track FilenameOrURL  to get the detailed information about the track file, and the available fields and their types.\n As a shortcut to enter track function for multiple files, you can use wildcast characters in the first parameter (filename) of the track function. This will result in multiple track() function calls for each matching filename. For example, if you have A01.BAM and A02.BAM in the current directory, function track('A*.BAM', 'calls') is equivalent to track('A01.BAM', 'calls') track('A02.BAM', 'calls'). The return values of the returned field will be numeric if the column contains numeric data (e.g. flag, score, position). Only the first record will be returned if a variant matches multiple records in the track file. If an option all=1 is passed to field (e.g. track('my.bam', 'info?all=1')), the track function will output all matching records as string, separated by a delimiter |. This function automatically chooses correct chromosome name (adding chr to chromosome name if needed), and position (adjust to 0-based position if needed) to match records in the track file. The return values are not adjusted. That is to say, columns such as pos will be 0-based for 0-based track files (e.g. bigBed files), and 1-based for 1-based track files (e.g. vcf).  Please refer to here for more details of command vtools show, especially a brief description of the BAM header.\nTabixed vcf tracks VCF files that can be used as tracks must be bgzipped and tabix-indexed. Regular vcf files can be converted to this format using commands bgzip my.vcf and tabix -p vcf my.vcf.gz. Parameter col for this format can be 1 (chrom), 2 (start, 1-based), 3 (name), 4 (ref), 5 (alt alleles), 6 (qual), 7 (filter), 8 (info), 9 (format string), 10 and more (for genotype columns for sample col-9); names of the columns \u0026quot;chrom\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;pos\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ref\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;qual\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;filter\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;info\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;format\u0026quot;; name of information fields available in the vcf file in the format of info.FIELD; name of samples for genotype columns, and name of genotype info fields in the format of SAMPLE.FIELD. If no col is specified, a default value 8 is passed to display the full INFO column of the vcf file.\n Examples: Annotate variants using vcf tracks Let us get some test data, and index the vcf file using the tabix program\n% vtools init track % vtools admin --load_snapshot vt_testData % tabix -p vcf CEU.vcf.gz % vtools import CEU.vcf.gz --build hg18 INFO: Importing variants from CEU.vcf.gz (1/1) CEU.vcf.gz: 100% [============================================] 300 13.9K/s in 00:00:00 INFO: 288 new variants (288 SNVs) from 300 lines are imported.

This allows you to show the number of reference and alternative alleles for SNV variants, but not so informative for indels. reads: display a small piece of nucleotide sequence around the variant location (default to 5, namely the variant location and 4 base after it), separated by |. _ will be displayed if the position goes beyond the end of a read. A parameter can be specified in the form of reads?start=-5\u0026amp;width=10 to change the starting point and width of displayed sequence. qual: A list of phred base quality of reads at the location. avg_qual: Average qual scores of all reads. mapq: A list of phred-scaled quality of alignment at the location. avg_mapq: Average map qual scores of all reads. Any tag values listed at the end of command vtools show track.  Parameters can be used to limit the reads to count or display, and change the way reads are displayed. The bam track currently supports the following options:\n type: If set to `(matched to reference sequence),1(unmatched single nucleotide),2(insertion) and3` (deletion), only reads that are matched, unmatched (single nucleotide), insertion or deletion at the variant location is counted or outputted. Note that nucleotide before the insertion will be matched to reference genome, but they are not counted as matched. min_mapq: limits the reads to those with mapq scores that exceed the specified value. min_qual: limits the reads to those with qual scores that execeed the specified value. color=[1|0]: display variant location in blue, and insertions in green for reads field. limit: limit the number of reads or calls to display if the depth of coverage is high. delimiter: character (e.g. \\t to separate reads in the reads output (| is used by default). show_seq=[1|0]: A . is used by default when the nucleotide matches the reference genome at the location. The actual nucleotide sequence will be displayed if this option is set to 1.  You can count the number of reads that match (or unmatch) the reference genome using parameter coveragetype=0@@.\n Examples: Use BAM files to check the details of variant calls.  Now suppose that we have a project with a list of variants (due to the size of BAM files, original data is not provided), we select the variants based on the sample from which they are called:\n% vtools select variant --samples \u0026quot;sample_name = 'WGS4_9'\u0026quot; -t ex49 INFO: 1 samples are selected by condition: sample_name = 'WGS4_9' Running: 3,959 164.5/s in 00:00:24 INFO: 1191 variants selected.

It creates a single variant table for the results.\n This pipeline creates a bunch of variant tables for variants that are in different annotation databases.\n  Usage % vtools show pipeline transmission Pipelines to detect different types of variants that are transmitted from parents to offspring. Available pipelines: denovo, recessive Pipeline \u0026quot;denovo\u0026quot;: This pipeline identifies de novo mutations from a family of unaffected parents, affected offspring, and optional unaffected siblings. It can be applied either to the current project (no --input is specified), or a snapshot (--input) for which the snapshot will be loaded and overwrite the existing project. The parameter --parents and --offspring are required to specify the name of parents, proband (affected offspring), and one optional sibling. Parameter --name is recommended to give all variant tables a prefix. This pipeline will produce tables $name_denovo (variants that are observed only in the proband), A table $name_denovo_SNP will be created with all SNP markers in table $name_denovo. And, depending on values of parameter --databases, it can produce tables $table_1kg for variants in 1000 genomes project, $table_dbSNP for variants in dbSNP project, and $table_refGene, $table_refGene_exon, $table_ccdsGene, $table_ccdsGene_exon, $table_CancerGenomeCensus, $table_COSMIC, $table_dbNSFP, $table_phastCons, $table_phastConsElements, $table_genomicSuperDups for tables in respective annotation databases. It is up to you to select variants based on these membership tables using the 'vtools compare' command. The project will be saved to a snapshot if a name (or filename with extension .tar or .tar.gz) is specified as the output. denovo_0: Load specified snapshot if a snapshot is specified. Otherwise use the existing project. denovo_5: Check the version of variant tools (version 2.2.1 and above is required to execute this pipeline) denovo_10: Import all annotation databases denovo_20: Locate de novo variants of the proband denovo_50: Create variant tables according to their membership in different annotation databases denovo_100: Save the project to a snapshot if an output is specified. denovo_200: Summarize the results. Pipeline \u0026quot;recessive\u0026quot;: This pipeline identifies recessive mutations from a family of unaffected parents, affected offspring, and optional unaffected siblings. Recessive variant is defined as variants that are homozygous in the affected offspring (proband), heterozygous in both parents, and heterozygous or wildtype in a sibling (if available). The pipeline can be applied either to the current project (no --input is specified), or a snapshot (--input) for which the snapshot will be loaded and overwrite the existing project. The parameter --parents and --offspring are required to specify the name of parents, proband (affected offspring), and one optional sibling. Parameter --name is recommended to give all variant tables a prefix. This pipeline will produce tables $name_recessive (variants that are observed only in the proband). A table $name_denovo_SNP will be created with all SNP markers in table $name_denovo.

For a project with two unaffected parents, affected offspring (proband), and an optional sibling, this pipeline\n identify variants for each sample identify variants that appear only in the affected offspring, save it to a variant table $name_denovo identify a subset of variants that have no other parental variants at the variant sites, save it to table $name_denovo_site identify variants that belong to a number of annotation databases and save them to their respective variant tables.  The pipeline writes a summary of tables created to the standard output, and save the project to a snapshot if a name or filename is assigned to parameter --output.\nFor example, the following command\n% vtools execute transmission denovo --input poly_data.tar \\ --parents WGS3_2 WGS3_3 --offspring WGS3_1 --output denovo.tar \\ \u0026gt; logfile  produces a log file\n% cat logfile SUMMARY: Identification of de novo variants for family family Members: WGS3_2 WGS3_3 (unaffected parents), WGS3_1 (affected offspring) Number of genotypes: WGS3_2 : 4367814 WGS3_3 : 4455890 WGS3_1 : 4343418 de novo variants: family_denovo : 113553 (de novo variants for family family ) family_denovo_SNP: 63578 (de novo SNP variants for family family ) Database membership: family_denovo_in_thousandGenomes: 18330 (de novo variants in database thousandGenomes) family_denovo_in_dbSNP: 71921 (de novo variants in database dbSNP) family_denovo_in_refGene: 40037 (de novo variants in database refGene) family_denovo_in_ccdsGene: 28427 (de novo variants in database ccdsGene) family_denovo_in_refGene_exon: 1099 (de novo variants in database refGene_exon) family_denovo_in_ccdsGene_exon: 235 (de novo variants in database ccdsGene_exon) family_denovo_in_CosmicCodingMuts: 73 (de novo variants in database CosmicCodingMuts) family_denovo_in_CosmicNonCodingVariants: 111 (de novo variants in database CosmicNonCodingVariants) family_denovo_in_dbNSFP: 148 (de novo variants in database dbNSFP) family_denovo_in_phastCons: 101916 (de novo variants in database phastCons) family_denovo_in_phastConsElements: 3502 (de novo variants in database phastConsElements) family_denovo_in_genomicSuperDups: 24836 (de novo variants in database genomicSuperDups)  Identification of recessive variants in a family with affected offspring This pipeline works similarly to the denovo pipeline (with the same input, output and other options), but tried to identify variants that are recessive in the affected offspring, heterozygous in parents, and wildtype or heterozygous in the unaffected sibling, if available.\nVariants on sex chromosomes are handled in the same way as variants on autosomes. There must be some genotyping error if you observe recessive variants on chromosome Y. If you observe recessive variants on chromosome X, it means the variant is heterozygous for mother, and exists in father.\nWhat is next? The pipelines identify recessive or de novo variants and create a bunch of tables. You usually should filter the list more using combination of memberships, quality scores, and other information. For example, if you are looking for novel variants that are not in 1000 genomes, in exon regions, with high conservation score, not in genomic duplication regions, you can select the variants using command\n% vtools compare --expression 'mylist=family_denovo - family_denovo_in_thousandGenomes - \\ (family_denovo - (family_denovo_in_refGene_exon | family_denovo_phastConsElements)) - \\ family_denovo_genomicSuperDups'  and start looking closely at these variants, using commands such as\n% vtools output mylist chr pos ref alt 'ref_sequence(chr, pos, pos+20)' \u0026quot;track('mydata.bam', 'reads')\u0026quot;  "

Instead, all the information, including results of analysis, are saved in the project in a consistent manner. An extra step is needed to output the information you need. In other words, the management and presentation of information regarding variants are two different processes, and you typically add more and more information to your project during analysis of your data. The end result is that you have immediate access to a large amount of information for the variants you are interested in, which can in turn help you perform more in-depth analysis. Using a fabricated and unusually long command,\n% vtools output # 2 myvariants # 1 chr pos ref alt # 3 hom_case hom_ctrl # 4 dbNSFP.SIFT_score dbSNP.name refGene.name2 # 5 asso1.p_value asso2.p_value # 6 \u0026ldquo;ref_sequence(chr, pos - 5, pos + 5)\u0026rdquo; # 7\n\u0026ldquo;track(\u0026lsquo;LP056A.BAM\u0026rsquo;)\u0026rdquo; # 8 \u0026ldquo;genotype(\u0026lsquo;WGS1\u0026rsquo;)\u0026rdquo; # 9 \u0026ldquo;samples()\u0026rdquo;\n myvariants contains a list of variants, which is a subset of the master variant table (all the variant of your project) and is typically created using command vtools select. Command vtools output output information for all variants in myvariant, which include chr, pos, ref, alt constitute a variant, namely location and type of a mutation. hom_case and hom_ctrl are number of homozygous genotypes of this variant in cases and controls. These are called variant info fields and are added to the project using command vtools update --from_stat dbNSFP.SIFT_score, dbSNP.name and refGene.name2 are annotation information from different annotation databases. Annotation databases are not part of the project. They are connected to the project using command vtools use. asso1.p_value and asso2.p_value are results of two different association analysis. These are annotation databases created by command vtools associate. \u0026lt;a class='createlinktext' rel='nofollow' href='http://localhost/~iceli/wiki/pmwiki.php?n=Vtools.Commands?action=edit'\u0026gt;ref_sequence\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a rel='nofollow' class='createlink' href='http://localhost/~iceli/wiki/pmwiki.php?n=Vtools.Commands?action=edit'\u0026gt;?\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;(chr, pos-5, pos+5) is a function provided by variant tools to retrieve the reference sequence around the variant.

In this example, the depth of coverage at the location of the variant in the specified bam file is returned. \u0026lt;a class='createlinktext' rel='nofollow' href='http://localhost/~iceli/wiki/pmwiki.php?n=Vtools.Commands?action=edit'\u0026gt;genotype\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a rel='nofollow' class='createlink' href='http://localhost/~iceli/wiki/pmwiki.php?n=Vtools.Commands?action=edit'\u0026gt;?\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;('WGS1') is another function to get the genotype of this variant in sample WGS1, for example, 1 for heterozygote and 2 for homozygote. Function samples() lists the samples that contain the variant.  As you can see, individual commands such as vtools use and vtools update do not produce any output, but adds information to the project that can be displayed along with others. Then, it is important to remember that all such information can be used to select, prioritize, and analyze your variants. Another fabricated command would look like\n% vtools select # 1 myvariants # 2 \u0026ldquo;refGene.name2=\u0026lsquo;BRCA1\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; # 3 \u0026lsquo;dbNSFP.SIFT_score \u0026gt; 0.95\u0026rsquo;\n\u0026lsquo;hom_case \u0026gt; 15\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;hom_ctrl = 0\u0026rsquo; # 4 \u0026lsquo;asso1.p_value \u0026lt; 0.05 OR asso2.p_value \u0026lt; 0.05\u0026rsquo; # 5 \u0026ndash;to_table significant # 6\n Command vtools select selects variants according to their properties It starts from table myvariants, which was itself selected using some other crieteria, The variants must be in gene BRCA1 and must have \u0026gt; 0.95 SIFT scores (probably damagin) it should appear in at least 15 of the cases as homozygote, and not available (as homozygote) in any of the controls and it should be significant in one of the association tests, the selected variant are written to another table names significant.  In summary,** variant tools is NOT designed to be a black-box tool that analyzes your data and generates a nice-looking report with a list of candidate variants or genes. It is a platform under which you can analyze your data using several methods, compare and analyze results, re-compare and re-analyze, and again using different methods or annotation sources, based on the information abtained from your previous analyses.** The unique advantage of variant tools is that you generally do not need to write a bunch of scripts to connect input output of different tools and parse and compare results in different formats, and you have easy access to a huge amount of information that help you select, prioritize and analyze your variants, all from your command line. However, because of the uniqueness of this design, please read through the Concepts? section of this website before using variant tools.\nThings you can do with variant tools    Catagory Tasks     Variant calling Call variants from raw reads in FASTQ or BAM (convert to FASTQ first) formats using the GATK best practice pipeline.?

	"content": " genotypes of one or more samples Usage Genotype information for a variant is not directly available in variant tools commands such as vtools output because these commands only output variant info or annotation fields. Function genotype can be used to retrieve genotypes of one or more samples from the genotype tables. In its single-sample mode, this function accepts a sample name and an optional field to display,\ngenotype(sample_name, params='')  where params can have be multiple parameters joined by \u0026amp;. For example, functions\ngenotype('WGS1') genotype('WGS1', 'field=DP')  returns the genotype (0 for homozygous wild type, 1 for heterzygous alternative, 2 for homozygous alternative, and -1 for one of the double alternative alleles) or genotype field DP of sample WGS1. '.' will be returned if sample WGS1 does not contain the variant.\nDetails  Examples: Use genotype function to get genotypes of samples\nLet us get a simple project and name the samples properly\n% vtools admin --load_snapshot vt_simple % vtools admin --rename_samples \u0026quot;filename='V2.vcf'\u0026quot; SAMP2 % vtools admin --rename_samples \u0026quot;filename='V3.vcf'\u0026quot; SAMP3 % vtools show samples sample_name filename SAMP1 V1.vcf SAMP2 V2.vcf SAMP3 V3.vcf  There are about 1000 genotypes in three samples:\n% vtools show genotypes sample_name filename num_genotypes sample_genotype_fields SAMP1 V1.vcf 989 GT SAMP2 V2.vcf 990 GT SAMP3 V3.vcf 988 GT  Now, in addition to the variant inforation, we would like to see the genotype of variants in sample SAMP1\n% vtools output variant chr pos ref alt \u0026quot;genotype('SAMP1')\u0026quot; -l 10 1 4540 G A 1 1 5683 G T 1 1 5966 T G 1 1 6241 T C 1 1 9992 C T 1 1 9993 G A 1 1 10007 G A 1 1 10098 G A 2 1 14775 G A 2 1 16862 A G 2  The genotype can also be used to select variants. For example, the following command select variants when their genotypes in SAMP1 is heterzygous. When we output genotypes of these variants in two samples, some of them are not available in SAMP2 and are displayed as missing (.).\n% vtools select variant \u0026quot;genotype('SAMP1')=1\u0026quot; --output chr pos ref alt \\ \u0026quot;genotype('SAMP1')\u0026quot; \u0026quot;genotype('SAMP2')\u0026quot; -l 10 1 4540 G A 1 . 1 5683 G T 1 . 1 5966 T G 1 1 1 6241 T C 1 . 1 9992 C T 1 . 1 9993 G A 1 . 1 10007 G A 1 1 1 20723 G C 1 1 1 29539 C T 1 . 1 39161 T C 1 .  In addition to genotype, you can use the genotype() funciton to display other genotype info fields (c.f. vtools show genotypes, for example, for a project with genotype info field DP_geno, we can specify name of the genotype info field as a second parameter:\n% vtools init genotype -f % vtools import CEU.vcf.gz --geno_info DP_geno --build hg18 % vtools output variant chr pos ref alt \u0026quot;genotype('NA12874')\u0026quot; \u0026quot;genotype('NA12874', 'field=DP_geno')\u0026quot; -l 10 1 533 G C 1 9 1 41342 T A 0 3 1 41791 G A 0 2 1 44449 T C 0 0 1 44539 C T 0 0 1 44571 G C 0 0 1 45162 C T 0 1 1 52066 T C 1 3 1 53534 G A 0 0 1 75891 T C 0 0  \nThe first parameter can also be a condition based on which several samples are selected (default to all samples). In this case, this function will return a list of genotypes (for default field='GT') or other fields. Two additional parameters are acceptable (joined by \u0026amp;):\n delimiter: Delimiter, defalt to ,. missing: If a sample does not contain the variant, output this string instead of ignoreing the sample.  For example, functions\ngenotype() genotype('aff=1') genotype('BMI\u0026gt;20', 'field=DP_geno\u0026amp;missing=.')  returns genotypes of all samples, samples with aff=1, and depth of coverage of of all samples with BMI \u0026gt; 20, respectively.\n Examples: Display genotypes of multiple samples It is straightforward to list genotypes of all samples that contain the variant:\n% vtools init genotype -f % vtools admin --load_snapshot vt_simple % vtools import CEU.vcf.gz --geno_info DP_geno --build hg18 % vtools remove genotypes 'GT=0' % vtools output variant chr pos ref alt \u0026quot;genotype()\u0026quot; -l 10 1 533 G C 1,1,1,1,1,1 1 41342 T A 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1 1 41791 G A 1,1,1,1,1 1 44449 T C 1,1 1 44539 C T 1,1 1 44571 G C 1,1,1,1,1,1,1 1 45162 C T 1,2,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,2 1 52066 T C 1,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1 1 53534 G A 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1 1 75891 T C 2,1,2,1,1,1,2,1  If you would like to limit the samples, you can pass a condition (c.f. vtools show samples)\n% vtools phenotype --from_file phenotype.txt % vtools output variant chr pos ref alt \u0026quot;genotype('BMI\u0026gt;24')\u0026quot; -l 10 1 533 G C . 1 41342 T A 1,1 1 41791 G A 1 1 44449 T C . 1 44539 C T . 1 44571 G C 1,1,1 1 45162 C T 1 1 52066 T C 1,1 1 53534 G A 1 1 75891 T C 2  If you need to know which samples have these genotypes, you can use function samples() with the same condition.\n% vtools output variant chr pos ref alt \u0026quot;samples('BMI\u0026gt;24')\u0026quot; -l 10 1 533 G C . 1 41342 T A NA11918,NA12814 1 41791 G A NA11918 1 44449 T C . 1 44539 C T . 1 44571 G C NA12003,NA12287,NA12751 1 45162 C T NA12814 1 52066 T C NA12003,NA12751 1 53534 G A NA12287 1 75891 T C NA12814  Using strings inside the condition is bit tricky because you need to use backslash to pass condition sex='F' to the genotype function in the following example:\n% vtools output variant chr pos ref alt \u0026quot;genotype('sex=\\'F\\'')\u0026quot; -l 10 1 533 G C 1,1,1,1 1 41342 T A 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1 1 41791 G A 1,1,1 1 44449 T C 1,1 1 44539 C T 1,1 1 44571 G C 1,1,1,1,1 1 45162 C T 1,2,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1 1 52066 T C 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1 1 53534 G A 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1 1 75891 T C 2,1,2,1,2  Finally, if you would like to view values of other genotype info fields (c.f. vtools show genotypes), or using alternative delimiters, you can\n% vtools output variant chr pos ref alt \u0026quot;genotype('BMI\u0026gt;23', 'field=DP_geno\u0026amp;d=\\t\u0026amp;missing=.')\u0026quot; -l 10 1 533 G C . . . . . . . . . . 1 41342 T A . 1 4 3 . . . . 0 9 1 41791 G A . 2 . . . . . . . . 1 44449 T C . . . . . . . . . . 1 44539 C T . . . . . . . . . . 1 44571 G C . . . . 1 1 4 1 . . 1 45162 C T 4 . . . . . . . . 7 1 52066 T C . . 3 . 1 . . 1 . . 1 53534 G A 5 . . . . . 5 . . . 1 75891 T C . . . . . . . . . 6  \n Whereas the return value of genotype(sample_name) is an integer, the return value of genotype(sample_cond) is always a string, evern if only one sample is selected by the condition. You could match returned genotypes with samples by comparing the output of genotype(sample_cond) with the output of samples(sample_cond).  "

Samples are determined by sample names in the first column, or jointly by sample name and filename if there is another column with header 'filename'. Names of phenotype fields are determined by header of the input file, or by names provided from option --header. Non-alphanumeric characters in input filed names will be replaced by '_'. If multiple samples in a project share the same names, they will shared the imported phenotypes. Optionally, a list of phenotypes (columns of the file) can be specified after filename, in which case only the specified phenotypes will be imported. Parameter --samples could be used to limit the samples for which phenotypes are imported. Values that match value of parameter --na and cannot be converted to the probed type of phenotype (e.g. '' in a column of numbers) are recorded as missing values. --set [EXPRESSION [EXPRESSION ...]] Set a phenotype to a constant (e.g. --set aff=1), or an expression using other existing phenotypes (e.g. --set ratio_qt=high_qt/all_qt (the ratio of the number of high quality variants to the number of all variants, where high_qt and all_qt are obtained from sample statistics using parameter --from_stat). Parameter --samples could be used to limit the samples for which genotypes will be set. --from_stat [EXPRESSION [EXPRESSION ...]] Set a phenotype to a summary statistics of a genotype field. For example, \u0026quot;num=count(*)\u0026quot; sets phenotype num to be the number of genotypes of a sample, \u0026quot;GD=avg(DP)\u0026quot; sets phenotype DP to be the average depth (if DP is one of the genotype fields) of the sample. Multiple fields (e.g. '--from_stat \u0026quot;num=count(*)\u0026quot; \u0026quot;GD=avg(DP)\u0026quot;') are also allowed. In addition to standard SQL aggregation functions, variant tools supports special functions #(GT), #(wtGT), #(mutGT), #(alt), #(hom), #(het) and #(other), which counts the number of genotypes (the same as count(*)), wildtype genotypes, mutant genotypes alternative alleles, homozygotes, heterozygotes, and genotypes with two different alternative alleles. Parameters --genotypes and --samples could be used to limit the genotypes to be considered and the samples for which genotypes will be set. --output [EXPRESSION [EXPRESSION ...]] A list of phenotype to be outputted. SQL-compatible expressions or functions such as \u0026quot;DP/DP_all\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;avg(DP)\u0026quot; are also allowed -j N, --jobs N Allow at most N concurrent jobs to obtain sample statistics for parameter --from_stat. -g [COND [COND ...]], --genotypes [COND [COND ...]] Limit the operation to genotypes that match specified conditions. Use 'vtools show genotypes' to list usable fields for each sample. -s [COND [COND ...]], --samples [COND [COND ...]] Update phenotype for samples that match specified conditions. Use 'vtools show samples' to list usable fields in the sample table. -v {0,1,2}, --verbosity {0,1,2} Output error and warning (0), info (1) and debug (2) information to standard output (default to 1). Input/Output options: --header [HEADER [HEADER ...]] A list of header names for input file if used with option --from_file. Otherwise a complete header or a list of names that will be joined by a delimiter (parameter --delimiter), for option --output. If a special name - is specified, the header will be read from the standard input, which is the preferred way to specify large multi-line headers (e.g. cat myheader | vtools export --header -). If this parameter is given without parameter, a default header will be derived from field names. -d DELIMITER, --delimiter DELIMITER Delimiter, default to tab, a popular alternative is ',' for csv output --na NA Input or output string for missing value.. -l LIMIT, --limit LIMIT Number of record to display. Default to all record.  Details Unlike vtools import and vtools update, this command imports/adds properties to samples rather than to variants. These properties include:\n Extra phenotype information imported from a tab-delimited file, via --from_file FILE Some values calculated from other phenotype columns, via --set \u0026quot;EXPRESSION\u0026quot; Summary statistics of genotype info of the samples, via --from_stat \u0026quot;EXPRESSION\u0026quot;  Any properties of sample individuals are considered a phenotype in vtools phenotype, including sample genotype information such as genotype calls quality, genotype depth of coverage and homozygote/heterozygote counts, etc., which can be useful in data quality control processes.\nThe difference between --set and --from_stat is that --set uses expressions with existing phenotype (fields in vtools show samples), and --from_stat uses expressions with genotype information.\nImporting phenotypes from text files The vtools phenotype --from_file command identifies a sample by its name but it can also identify a sample by a combination of sample name and file name because not all samples have names. The basic form of this command imports phenotype by sample names from a tab or comma delimited file.\n Examples: Create a new project To illustrate the use of this command, let\u0026rsquo;s start a new project and import some variants/genotypes\n% vtools init test -f % vtools admin --load_snapshot vt_testData % vtools import CEU.vcf.gz --build hg18 --var_info DP --geno_info DP_geno INFO: Importing variants from CEU.vcf.gz (1/1) CEU.vcf.gz: 100% [=================================] 300 14.0K/s in 00:00:00 INFO: 288 new variants (288 SNVs) from 300 lines are imported.

Values that match value specified by parameter --na or cannot be converted to probed type (e.g. '' or None in a column of numbers) will be treated as missing values.\nIf you have a large number of phenotypes and you only need to import some of them, you can specify a list of phenotypes after the filename.\n Examples: Import selected phenotypes from a file\nLet us first remove the phenotypes we just loaded:\n% vtools remove phenotypes aff sex BMI % vtools show phenotypes -l 10 sample_name NA06985 NA06986 NA06994 NA07000 NA07037 NA07051 NA07346 NA07347 NA07357 NA10847 (50 records omitted, use parameter --limit to display more or all records)  and only import the sex phenotype from the file:\n% vtools phenotype --from_file phenotype.txt sex INFO: Adding phenotype sex INFO: 1 field (1 new, 0 existing) phenotypes of 60 samples are updated. % vtools show phenotypes -l 10 sample_name sex NA06985 F NA06986 M NA06994 F NA07000 F NA07037 F NA07051 F NA07346 F NA07347 M NA07357 M NA10847 M (50 records omitted, use parameter --limit to display more or all records)  \nOther features of this command include\n You can load phenotypes for only selected samples, which are specified by conditions such as --samples 'sample_name like \u0026quot;\u0026lt;span class='NB'\u0026gt;\u0026quot;'. The input file can be tab, comma, or space delimited. The command will automatically detect the delimiter used. The input file can have windows or Linux newlines, even the lengendary \\M newline that is still outputted by the MaxOSX version of Excel. The input file can be standard input if specify - as input filename. This allows you to use a pipe to send me phenotype file. variant tools automatically translate non-standard header names to a valid variant tools field name, by replacing non-alphanumeric characters with underscores ('_').  If your input file does not have any header, you can use option --header to specify a list of headers. This is helpful for importing plink .pfam file, using a command similar to vtools phenotype --from_file /tmp/test.tfam --header Family_ID sample_name Paternal_ID Maternal_ID Gender Status\nNew columns based on other phenotypes vtools phenotype --set command allows users to create new columns in the phenotype table based on other phenotypes.\n Examples: Create a column race from CEU samples having race=1\n% vtools phenotype --set 'race=1' --samples 'filename like \u0026quot;%CEU%\u0026quot;' INFO: Adding field race INFO: 1 field (1 new, 0 existing) phenotypes of 60 samples are updated. % vtools show samples -l -1 filename sample_name aff sex BMI race vcf/CEU.vcf.gz NA06985 2 F 19.64 1 vcf/CEU.vcf.gz NA06986 1 M None 1 vcf/CEU.vcf.gz NA06994 1 F 19.49 1 vcf/CEU.vcf.gz NA07000 2 F 21.52 1 vcf/CEU.vcf.gz NA07037 2 F 23.05 1 vcf/CEU.vcf.gz NA07051 1 F 21.01 1 ... vcf/SAMP1.vcf SAMP1 1 M 22.78 None vcf/SAMP2.vcf SAMP2 2 F 24.43 None  \nthe --samples option specify the subset of samples to which the new column value will be appended. Note above that None is assigned to samples that does not match the specified --samples condition. More examples on the --samples option are documented in vtools update, vtools select, etc.\nNew columns based on sample genotype and genotype information With vtools show genotypes we know the total number of genotypes and available genotype information in the sample. vtools phenotype --from_stat further allows calculation of specific sample genotype properties.\n Examples: Phenotype from genotype statistics\nvtools phenotype --from_stat \u0026quot;sample_total=#(GT)\u0026quot; vtools phenotype --from_stat \u0026quot;sample_alt=#(alt)\u0026quot; vtools phenotype --from_stat \u0026quot;sample_homo=#(hom)\u0026quot; vtools phenotype --from_stat \u0026quot;sample_het=#(het)\u0026quot; vtools phenotype --from_stat \u0026quot;sample_double_het=#(other)\u0026quot; vtools show samples filename sample_name aff sex BMI race sample_total sample_alt sample_homo sample_het sample_double_het vcf/CEU.vcf.gz NA06985 2 F 19.64 1 287 110 40 30 0 vcf/CEU.vcf.gz NA06986 1 M None 1 287 126 31 64 0 vcf/CEU.vcf.gz NA06994 1 F 19.49 1 287 130 37 56 0  gives statistic of different genotypes.\n Wild-type genotype can be directly calculated using vtools phenotype --set \u0026quot;sample_wt=sample_total-sample_homo-sample_het-sample_double_het\u0026quot;  \nAnother useful type of summary is the genotype information that usually summarizes genotype data quality. Notice that at the beginning of this example session we included genotype depth of coverage using option --geno_info. With this (and as many others as your vcf file provides) genotype information you can calculate summary statistics and append them to sample table. For example, DP_geno is the read depth for sample genotypes, a useful indicator of sample genotype quality. You may summarize DP_geno for each individual using the commands below:\n Examples: Phenotype calculated from statistics of genotype info fields\n% vtools phenotype --from_stat \u0026quot;meanDP=avg(DP_geno)\u0026quot; \u0026quot;minDP=min(DP_geno)\u0026quot; \u0026quot;maxDP=max(DP_geno)\u0026quot; INFO: Adding field meanDP INFO: 60 values of 1 phenotypes (1 new, 0 existing) of 60 samples are updated.

They can both display all or a specified subset of phenotypes.\n Examples: Output specified phenotypes\n% vtools phenotype --output sample_name sample_wildtype BMI NA06985 217 19.64 NA06986 192 None NA06994 194 19.49 NA07000 215 21.52 NA07037 206 23.05 ...  \nThe power of command vtools phenotype --output, similar to vtools output, is its ability to output summary statistics of phenotypes. For example, you can use item avg(meanDP) to display the average of the meanDP field. Because pehnotype meanDP records average depth of all genotypes each sample, avg(meanDP) displays average depth of all genotypes of all samples.\n Examples: Output summary statistics of phenotypes\nFor example, the following command outputs the wildtype genotype counts and BMI for each sample.\n% vtools phenotype --output \u0026quot;count(filename)\u0026quot; 62 % vtools phenotype --output \u0026quot;avg(meanDP)\u0026quot; 4.52506351626  (:exampleend\n"

	"content": " Varible Thresholds Methods for Disease and Quantitative Traits Introduction This implements the variable thresholds version of aggregation methods?. Similar to the VT? method, the VariableThresholdsBt and VariableThresholdsQt tests use a variable thresholds definition for the rare variants being considered such that multiple test statistics are calculated for an aggregation unit. The final statistic is taken as the one that gives the best result. Type I error is controlled due to the use of permutation testing.\nResults from variable thresholds methods have one additional column, i.e., an MAF column reporting the statistic of VT at which it is derived.\nDetails Command interface vtools show test VariableThresholdsBt Name: VariableThresholdsBt Description: Variable thresholds method for disease traits, in the spirit of Price et al 2010 usage: vtools associate --method VariableThresholdsBt [-h] [--name NAME] [-q1 MAFUPPER] [-q2 MAFLOWER] [--alternative TAILED] [-p N] [--permute_by XY] [--adaptive C] [--NA_adjust] [--moi {additive,dominant,recessive}] Variable thresholds in burden test for disease traits (in the spirit of Price et al 2010).

The program will compute a p-value every 1000 permutations and compare the lower bound of the 95 percent CI of p-value against \u0026quot;C\u0026quot;, and quit permutations with the p-value if it is larger than \u0026quot;C\u0026quot;. It is recommended to specify a \u0026quot;C\u0026quot; that is slightly larger than the significance level for the study. To disable the adaptive procedure, set C=1. Default is C=0.1 --NA_adjust This option, if evoked, will replace missing genotype values with a score relative to sample allele frequencies. The association test will be adjusted to incorporate the information. This is an effective approach to control for type I error due to differential degrees of missing genotypes among samples. --moi {additive,dominant,recessive} Mode of inheritance.

It is also possible to provide a list of variants with physical positions to the Rutgers Map Interpolator and create your own annotation database using the rutgersMap format with --file option for vtools use command.\nDescription of the data from Rutgers Computational Genetics Lab:\nWe have constructed de novo a high-resolution genetic map that includes the largest set of polymorphic markers for which genotype data are publicly available: it combines genotype data from both the CEPH and deCODE pedigrees (for some markers), incorporates SNPs, also incorporates sequence-based positional information. The position of most markers on our map is corroborated by both genomic sequence and recombination-based data. This specific combination of features maximizes marker inclusion, coverage, and resolution, making this map uniquely suited as a comprehensive resource for determining genetic map information (order and distances) for any large set of polymorphic markers.\nrutgersMap % vtools show annotation rutgersMap -v2 Annotation database rutgersMap (version b134) Description: Rutgers Combined Linkage-Physical Map Database type: position Reference genome hg19: chr, position chr position one-based position in chromosome cm_avg map distance (cM), averaged cm_female map distance (cM), female cm_male map distance (cM), male  [^#^]\n"

	"content": " Import variants from file without ref and alt alleles Introduction From time to time, you might get a list of variants in map format, or as a list with only chromosome and position information. Reference and alternative alleles are not specified because the variants are from GWA studies with well-defined reference and alternative alleles. In this case, you can use format map, which automatically retrieve reference and alternative alleles from a specified dbSNP database.\nFormat specification vtools show format format/map.fmt Format: map Description: This input format imports variants from files in MAP format (with columns chr, name gen_dist, pos), or any delimiter-separated format with columns chr and pos. Because these input files do not contain reference and alternative alleles of variants, this format queries such information from the dbSNP database using chr and pos. Records that does not exist in dbSNP will be discarded. Records with multiple alternative alleles will lead to multiple records. Columns: None defined, cannot export to this format variant: chr Chromosome pos 1-based position ref Reference allele, '-' for insertion. alt Alternative allele obtained from another database Format parameters: db_file (default: dbSNP.DB) pos_idx Index of column for pyhysical location in the map file, should be 4 for a standard map file with chr, pos, gen_dist, pos. (default: 4) ref_field Name of ref field from the annotation database, used to retrieve reference allele at specified location. (default: refNCBI) alt_field Name of alt field from the annotation database, used to retrieve alternative allele at specified location. (default: alt) chr_field Name of chr field from the annotation database, used to locate variants from the dbSNP database. (default: chr) pos_field Name of pos field from the annotation database, used to locate variants from the dbSNP database. (default: start) separator Separator of the input file, default to space or tab. (default: None)  Examples You are given a list of variants with chromosome as the first column, and physical position as the third column:\nCHR SNP BP A1 12 rs11054701 12180423 C 12 rs2075241 12182746 C 12 rs2160521 12184905 T 12 rs10590349 12223570 G 12 rs10492120 12224619 C 12 rs3825258 12170662 C 12 rs11054697 12163740 C 12 rs16907786 12205869 A 12 rs11054665 12113442 G  Download dbSNP The first step is to get the right version of dbSNP. Because the variants are in hg18, you cannot use the default version of dbSNP, which uses hg19. Instead, you should run\nvtools show annotations vtools use dbSNP-hg18_130  The first command lists all available annotation databases, and the second command will download dbSNP and put a database such as dbSNP-hg18_130.DB under your project directory.\nImport and filter variants The default column for the position column is 4, but the input file has it at the third column, so you will need to use parameter --pos_idx 3. You do not have to set other parameters (fields) if you are using dbSNP database provided by variant tools.\nTo import the data, you can run command\nvtools import gwas_result.txt --format map --db_file dbSNP-hg18_130.DB \\ --pos_idx 3 --build hg18  This format will import multiple variants if there are multiple variants (usually SNV and indels) at the same location at dbSNP. For example, you can get one SNV and two deletions at position 12223570 of chromosome 12 in the following example.\nvtools output variant chr pos dbSNP.name ref alt 12 12180423 rs11054701 T C 12 12182746 rs2075241 G C 12 12184905 rs2160521 C T 12 12223570 rs7974059 G T 12 12223570 rs10590349 GATA - 12 12223570 rs56097732 GA - 12 12224619 rs10492120 C T 12 12170662 rs3825258 T C 12 12163740 rs11054697 T C 12 12205869 rs16907786 G A 12 12113442 rs11054665 T G  If you believe that all your variants are SNVs, you can run\nvtools select variant 'ref != \u0026quot;-\u0026quot;' 'alt != \u0026quot;-\u0026quot;' -t SNV  to put all SNVs into a separate table, or run\nvtools select variant 'ref = \u0026quot;-\u0026quot; OR alt = \u0026quot;-\u0026quot;' -t indels vtools remove variants indels  to remove all indels.\nThis format will ignore all variants that are not in dbSNP. If you would like to keep them, you can modify map.fmt, and add parameter default='-' to DatabaseQuerier.\n"

	"content": " Gene-based annotation through ANNOVAR Usage % vtools show pipeline ANNOVAR Pipeline to call ANNOVAR and import results as variant info fields. Available pipelines: geneanno Pipeline \u0026quot;geneanno\u0026quot;: This pipeline exports variants in specified variant table (parameter --var_table, default to variant), executes ANNOVAR's gene- based annotation (annotate_variantion.pl --geneanno), and imports specified fields from output of the command. Four fields (two for all variants and two for exonic variants) will be imported unless you disable some of them using parameters --variant_info and --exonic_info. No input or output file is required for this pipeline, but a snapshot could be specified, in which case the snapshot will be loaded (and overwrite the present project). geneanno_0: Load specified snapshot if a snapshot is specified. Otherwise use the existing project. geneanno_10: Check the existence of ANNOVAR's annotate_variation.pl command. geneanno_11: Determine the humandb path of ANNOVAR geneanno_14: Download gene database geneanno_20: Export variants in ANNOVAR format geneanno_30: Execute ANNOVAR annotate_variation.pl --geneanno geneanno_40: Importing results from ANNOVAR output .variant_function if --variant_info is specified geneanno_50: Importing results from ANNOVAR output .exonic_variant_function if --exonic_info is specified Pipeline parameters: var_table Variant table for the variants to be analyzed. (default: variant) annovar_path Path to a directory that contains annotate_variation.pl, if the script is not in the default $PATH. dbtype --dbtype parameter that will be passed to annotate_variation.pl --dbtype. The default value if refGene, but you can also use knownGene, ensGene. (default: refGene) variant_info Fields to import from the first two columns of .variant_function output of ANNOVAR. (default: region_type, region_name) exonic_info Fields to import from the .exonic_variant_function output of ANNOVAR. It has to be zero, one or more of mut_type and function. (default: mut_type, function)  Details This pipeline makes it easier to use (a small portion of) ANNOVAR\u0026rsquo;s gene-based annotation features to annotate variants, and update the variant tools project with the outputs. To use this pipeline, you should first download and install ANNOVAR somewhere, then execute a command similar to\n% vtools execute ANNOVAR geneanno --annovar_path ~/bin/annovar INFO: Executing step geneanno_0 of pipeline ANNOVAR: Load specified snapshot if a snapshot is specified.

	"content": " Specification of external file formats Roles of format specification in variant tools: Variant tools can import and export text files (or gzipped text files) in delimiter-separated format, namely records that are separated into columns by delimiters such as tab, space or comma. The file format must be variant-oriented (storing one or more variants by line), with the exception of sample-based PLINK format which is preprocessed internally into variant-oriented form for import. We use terms\n column for columns (text) in a delimiter-separated file, and field for fields (with types) in tables in a database, with  variant fields for fields that define variants (chr, pos, ref, alt), variant info for fields that annotate variants (e.g. membership to dbSNP), genotype fields for fields to store genotypes of samples, and genotype info for fields that annotate genotypes (e.g. quality score of each genotype)   A format specification defines how to extract fields from columns and how to write columns from fields, to\n Insert new variants to the project using command vtools import. The text file should provide at least four fields for chromosome, position, reference and alternative alleles. In addition to variant and variant info, an input file can contain genotype and genotype info for one or more samples.  The four fields could, but not necessarily have to, be in four columns because a field could be synthesized from multiple columns, even not from any existing column. For example, if all variants are from dbSNP, ref and alt fields could be looked up from a dbSNP annotation database.\n Update existing variants with additional info using command vtools update. The text files can have\n full variant information (chr, pos, ref and alt) to update matching variants and related genotypes and their info, or\n chromosomal positions (chr and pos) to update all variants at specified locations, or\n range (chr, start, end) to update variants in specified regions\n  Export samples and their variants using command vtools export. The file format should be organized by variant (not by sample). Although each line of the output file usually present a variant (chr, pos, ref, alt), it can contain multiple variants at a locus (chr, pos, ref, mutliple alternative alleles), or only locus-specific information (chr, pos).\n  The format specification file (.fmt file) A .fmt file describes the format of an external file so that it can be handled by variant tools. An format specification file follows an extended .ini format with section and key/value pairs. Details of this format can be found at this link because it is parsed by a Python ConfigParser object. This file should have at least a [format description] section and a few field sections. A format specification could be used to import and export files but you can ignore import or export specifications if you are only interested in exporting or importing.\nSection [format description] This section should have keys\n description: a description of the format, with preferably a URL to the documentation of the format.\n encoding (optional): encoding of the input file. If you see errors such as \u0026quot;codec can't decode byte 0xe7 in position 21480\u0026quot;, you should perhaps add encoding=ISO-8859-1 to your .fmt file.\n delimiter (optional): delimiter to define columns in the input file. Default to tab (delimiter='\\t'). If your input can be either tab or space delimited, use delimiter=None if your input does not have any missing field because '\\t\\t' or ' ' will be treated as a single delimiter. Quotations around other delimiters can be ignored (e.g. , instead of ',').\n header (optional): variant tools by default treats lines with a leading # as header and skip them during data importing. The header will also be used to probe sample names for some formats (e.g. .vcf). If your input file does not use such a header, you can override this behavior by specifying the number of lines to skip (header=1), or a pattern by which headers are matched (e.g. use header=^%.* for header lines starting with %, see documents of the Python re package for details).\n preprocessor (optional): a functor to pre-process input data into some intermediate format that can be readily imported by variant tools (e.g., PlinkConverter())\n export_by (optional, for export only): How variants at the same locus are exported. By default, variant tools exports one line for each variant. If fields specified by export_by (e.g. chr, pos) cannot uniquely identify variants so multiple variants will be outputted in one line, values at extra records will be ignored, or be collapsed to the first record if supported by column specification.\n sort_output_by (optional, for export only): How variants are ordered. This option is ignored if export_by is defined.\n  THIS OPTION IS CURRENTLY NOT USED\n merge_by (optional, for import only): If genotype at different homozygous copies (ploidy) is recorded in separate lines, this option has to be used to specify the columns to uniquely identify a variant. These columns will be passed to the processor without modification, values at all other columns are merged (separated by \u0026lsquo;,\u0026rsquo;).\n One of\n variant: fields for chr, pos, ref, and alt. Such input files have complete variant information and can be used to add new variants or add or update info of existing variants.\n position: fields for chr and pos for chromosomal positions.\n range: fields for chr, start and end positions of regions.\n   input files of the latter two types can only be used to update matching variants with additional variant_info.\n variant_info (optional): Additional fields that will be inserted to specified variant table.\n genotype (optional): name of a field that will be imported into the sample variant table. Using a slice-index syntax, this field can process genotypes for multiple samples (e.g. index=8: will produce genotypes from columns 8, 9, \u0026hellip;). The return value of this field must be value 1 for heterozygote, 2 for homozygote, and -1 for double heterozygote (alt1, alt2).\n genotype_info (optional): Fields such as quality score that will be appended to genotype of each sample. They should either generate a single value for all samples (regular index), or a different value for each sample (slice-index).\n  General speaking, genotype info fields are sample specific so different samples can have different values for the same variant. Variant info fields are supposed to be properties of variants and are shared by all (or part of the) samples. It is up to the user (and file format) to decide how to handle particular fields from input files.\nSection [DEFAULT] (define parameters of a format) The default section defines values that exist, conceptually, in all sections. It is used to define parameters used for import or export. These parameters could be overriden using corresponding command line option. For example, in the following .fmt file (partial)\n[format description] description=Output from ANNOVAR, generated from command \u0026quot;path/to/annovar/annotate_variation.pl annovar.txt path/to/annovar/humandb/\u0026quot;. This format imports chr, pos, ref, alt and ANNOVAR annotations. For details please refer to http://www.openbioinformatics.org/annovar/annovar_gene.html variant=chr, pos, ref, alt variant_info=%(var_info)s [DEFAULT] var_info=mut_type var_info_comment=Fields to be outputted, can be one or both of mut_type and function  The key var_info has a help message defined by parameter var_info_comment, and a default value mut_type. If you query the details of this format using command\n% vtools show format ANNOVAR_output  you will see at the end of the output the following description:\nOther fields (usable through parameters): function the gene name, the transcript identifier and the sequence change in the corresponding transcript Format parameters: var_info Fields to be outputted, can be one or both of mut_type and function. (default: mut_type)  This means you can pass an alternative value of var_info to this format using parameters such as --var_info function to change the variant information field to be imported or updated. For example, you can use command\n% vtools update variant input_file --format ANNOVAR_output --var_info mut_type function  to update two fields mut_type and function instead of the default one (mut_type).\nName of a variable cannot be any keyword (e.g. field, comment, adj, type) or start with fmt_.\nField sections (import: how to extract fields from input file) Import fields sections describe the fields that can be imported if they appear in one of variant, position, range, variant_info, genotype and genotype_info. Because the value of these fields could be overridden using corresponding parameters of command vtools import, a .fmt file might define additional or alternative fields to provide alternative ways to import data in this format.\nEach field section can have the following keys:\n index: index(es) of field, which can be\n A 1-based index of the column in the input file. The value at this column will be used for this field.\n A tuple syntax with multiple indexes separated by ',', for example 5,7. A list of values at specified columns will be passed to an adjust function to produce values of the field.\n A \u0026lsquo;slice\u0026rsquo; syntax to specify multiple fields. This syntax will only be used for genotype and genotype information fields. For example, index=8: will produce multiple fields from columns 8, 9, ... till end of the columns. Other examples include index=8::2 for 8, 10, 12, ..., index=5,8: for (5,8), (5,9), \u0026hellip;, and index=8::2,9::2 for (8,9), (10,11), etc\n  type: can be any SQL allowed types such as \u0026ldquo;INTEGER\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;FLOAT\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;INTEGER NOT NULL\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;DECIMAL(7,6) NOT NULL\u0026rdquo;\n comment (optional) a description of the field\n adj (optional): Functions or functors to extract or modify one or more values from the field value. variant tools provides a number of functors to help the processing of different fields. For example,\n IncreaseBy(inc=1) (increase value by inc). This is usually used to adjust 0-based position to 1-based position that is used by variant tools.\n MapValue(map) (map value to another). This function is used to map input value to another one, for example, MapValue({'het': '1', 'hom': '2'}) maps value \u0026lsquo;het\u0026rsquo; to \u0026lsquo;1\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;hom\u0026rsquo; to \u0026lsquo;2\u0026rsquo;. Note that the mapped values should be strings or None.\n Nullify(val) (treat value as NULL). This is usually used to adjust input NA values to NULL in the database.\n RemoveLeading(val) (remove leading characters). This is usually used to remove leading chr from inputs with chromosomes such as chr1, chr2, because variant tools only stores 1, 2, etc.\n ExtractField(index, sep=';', default=None) (field of a column): Split the item by sep and return the index-th field (1-based). Return default if there are less than index fields. For example, ExtractField(2, ':') extracts 20 from 10:20:30.\n  Multiple functors/functions can be used sequentially. For example, ExtractValue('CEU:'), ExtractField(1, '/') extracts value 12 from YRI:20/222;CEU:12/45 (the first extractor gets 12/45, the second extractor gets 12), and ExtractValue('CEU:'), SplitField('/') extracts values 12 and 45 from YRI:20/222;CEU:12/45.\n If none of the provided extractors can be used, you can define your own function. For example, lambda x: x[6:].replace(\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;\u0026quot;) extracts 24000 from COUNT=24,000. You can also mix function with variant tools provided extractor ExtractValue(\u0026quot;COUNT=\u0026quot;), lambda x: x.replace(\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;\u0026quot;)]) to extract 24000 from values such as ASD;COUNT=24,000;MAF=0.5.\n If the return value of at least one of the fields is a tuple of more than one values (e.g. result from functor SplitField), multiple records will be generated from this line. Non-tuple values of other fields will be copied automatically. For example, if three fields have values A1, (B1,), (C1, C2), they will produce two records of A1, B1, C1 and A1, None, C2.\n If you would like to exclude certain records, you can use adj to produce invalid records that will be excluded during importing. For example, a record with None alternative allele, or a field with NOT NULL type will be ignored, or a genotype with None mutation type will be ignored.\n  Section [Field formatter] (export: how to format fields for output) This section specifies how to format fields when they are outputted to a file. Fields that are not listed in this section will be converted to string directly, unless a special wildcast formatter fmt_* is specified. This section should look like\n[Field formatter] fmt_chr=Prepend('chr') fmt_freq=Formatter('{.3f}') fmt_id=ValueOfNull('.') fmt_other=lambda x: something  The name of the formatter should be field name prepended by fmt_. Formatter for each field should be a functor or a function. Their return value must be a string. More interestingly, multiple fields could be formatted altogether so it is possible to specify\nfmt_PL1,fmt_PL2,fmt_PL3=lambda x: x[0] + x[1] + x[2]  to create a single string from multiple fields.\nColumn sections (export: how to organize fields into columns of output file) Export reverses the import process. Instead of extracting fields from one or more columns, it generates columns from one or more fields. Column sections have title col_# where # is the index of column. They are specified in a similar way to fields. File formats without column specification cannot be used to export variants and samples.\nEach column section can have the following keys:\n field: name of field or fields that will be used to create a column. The fields are usually defined in this .fmt file. If a field specifies genotype or genotype information of more than one sample using a slice syntax, multiple columns will be generated. If multiple records are collapsed into a single record(c.f. export_by), a tuple of values will be passed to the adj function/functor if it is defined. Otherwise, only the first record will be exported.\n adj: function or functor that accepts values at one or more fields and produce a single value at this column.\n comment (optional) a description of the column\n  The basic steps of outputting a file is to collect values of all fields, apply formatters to each field (or groups of fields) if available, and collect results to columns. Note that\n Although fields of columns are usually the ones that are defined in a .fmt file, arbitrary fields could be outputted if fields of a column are configurable through parameters.\n A column is considered as a genotype column if it contains field GT. Multiple columns will be exported if genotypes of multiple samples are outputted.\n A field can generate multiple columns by using a formatter that returns, for example, \u0026lsquo;1,2\u0026rsquo; for a comma-separated format.\n  Import and test After a file is created, you can use command\nvtools import --format /path/to/fmt_file input_file --build specified_build  to import your file, and use command\nvtools show table variant -l -1  to check if variants are correctly imported. If you believe that your format is commonly used, please send the .fmt file to our mailinglist. We will post the file to the repository so that others can make use of it.\nExamples You can learn from the system format files on how to define a format:\n A basic example of a format with variant fields: ANNOVAR format. An example of using lambda functions to extract information from multiple columns: snps.txt created by CASAVA 1.8.  You can have a look at system format files using\nvtools show formats vtools show format SOME_FORMAT more cache/SOME_FORMAT.fmt  The first command gets a list of supported formats. The second command gets details of a specific format, and the third command lets you view the format file because all used formats are stored in a temporary directory named cache under your project folder.\n"

PLoS Genetics doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1001289. http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1001289^]. The key of this method is replication, i.e., in the two-sided test of RBT it computes evidences to reject each of the two hypothesis\n Deleterious rare variants are enriched in cases Protective rare variants are enriched in controls  The final statistic is based on the stronger of the two evidences, adjusted for multiple testing. To increase the power of this approach a weighting theme is applied to variant counts in case or control group using a transformation of the probability of observing such counts under a Poisson model.\nImplementation of RBT in this program has both one-sided and two-sided versions via the --alternative parameter. The one-sided testing strategy tests for the presence of variants conferring risk to disease by focusing on variants that have higher observed frequency in cases compared with controls. Permutation procedure is used in both one-sided and two-sided tests to obtain valid {$p$} value.\nDetails Command interface vtools show test RBT Name: RBT Description: Replication Based Test for protective and deleterious variants, Ionita-Laza et al 2011 usage: vtools associate --method RBT [-h] [--name NAME] [-q1 MAFUPPER] [-q2 MAFLOWER] [--alternative TAILED] [-p N] [--adaptive C] [--moi {additive,dominant,recessive}] Replication Based Test for protective and deleterious variants, Ionita-Laza et al 2011.

	"content": " The RefGene database was created from the UCSC database. RefGene specifies known human protein-coding and non-protein-coding genes taken from the NCBI RNA reference sequences collection (RefSeq). If you would like to annotate your variants to genes, you can use the simpler refGene database. If you would like to determine the exons that your variants are in, use the refGene_exon database. See the available annotation fields for each database below.\nDescription of the database from NCBI:\nRefSeqGene, a subset of NCBI\u0026rsquo;s Reference Sequence (RefSeq) project, defines genomic sequences to be used as reference standards for well-characterized genes. These sequences, labeled with the keyword RefSeqGene in NCBI\u0026rsquo;s nucleotide database, serve as a stable foundation for reporting mutations, for establishing conventions for numbering exons and introns, and for defining the coordinates of other variations. RefSeq mRNA and protein sequences have long been used for this purpose, but have the obvious weakness of not providing explicit coordinates for flanking or intronic sequence. RefSeq chromosome sequences do provide explicit coordinates no matter the relationship to any gene annotation, but have awkwardly large coordinate values that will change when the sequence is updated because of a re-assembly. Sequences of the RefSeqGene project counter both of these drawbacks by providing more stable gene-specific genomic sequence for each gene, as well as including upstream and downstream flanking regions. If modifications must be made to any RefSeqGene sequence, it will be versioned and tools will be provided to facilitate conversion of coordinates. The RefSeqGene sequences are aligned to reference chromosomes, and current and previous chromosome coordinates are available because of that re-alignment. The Clinical Remap tool make that conversion easy.\nAlthough the majority of UCSC Known Genes (KG) are identical to RefSeq genes, there are some significant differences according to this post:\n Not every RefSeq is a KG. Some RefSeqs were filtered out because they did not pass our gene-check processing step (e.g. RefSeqs with no start or stop codons, or bad reading frames are filtered out). If there is a UniProt protein which maps well to a GenBank mRNA, and it passes the gene-check filter and there is no equal or better corresponding RefSeq, the mRNA/UniProt pair will be added to the KG data set. UCSC KG is updated once in a few months. Our RefSeq track is updated nightly. So the refGene table may contains some latest RefSeq updates that came after the last KG build.  refGene % vtools show annotation refGene -v2 Annotation database refGene (version hg19_20130904) Description: Known human protein-coding and non-protein-coding genes taken from the NCBI RNA reference sequences collection (RefSeq).

	"content": " Samples that harbor the variant Usage The samples function is similar to genotype but it returns name of samples that contain the variant. When you use the function in command vtools output var_table samples(), this function will be evaluated for each variant in the variant table var_table. In its basic form,\nsamples()  returns a list of comma-separated names of samples that contain the variant, regardless the type of variant (homozygote etc).\nThis function returns all samples that contain the variant, so it will return samples without genotype info (no GT column, and samples with homozygote wildtype allele (genotype with GT=0) as long as the variant is included in the sample.\nDetails The samples function accepts an optional parameter with \u0026amp; separated KEY=VAL pairs. Supported KEY include\n sample_filter. A condition to select samples, using sample names of phenotype (e.g. aff=1). (c.f. command vtools show samples or vtools show phenotypes) geno_filter. Select samples by type of variant in the sample, using genotype type (GT) or genotype info fields (e.g. DP_geno). (c.f. command vtools show genotypes). For example, if you use condition GT=2, only samples with homozygote alternative alleles will be returned. delimiter. Delimiter to seprate sample names, default to ,. You can set it to \\t to output tab separated lists.  For example, command\nsamples() samples('sample_filter=aff=1') samples('geno_filter=GT=1')  returns the\n name of samples that contains the variant, name of samples with phenotype aff=1 (cases) that contains the variant name of samples that contains heterzygote genotype of the variant.

PLoS Computational Biology doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000954. http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000954^] is an efficient heuristic greedy algorithm to find an optimized combination of variants in a loci with the strongest association signal. It uses the same collapsing strategy and test statistic as in Li and Leal, 2008[^Bingshan Li and Suzanne M. Leal (2008) Methods for Detecting Associations with Rare Variants for Common Diseases: Application to Analysis of Sequence Data. The American Journal of Human Genetics doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2008.06.024. http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0002929708004084^] but scans over the loci, adding at each iteration the variants that contributes most to the statistic.\nRareCover is related to the Variable Thresholds test? yet differs in the sequence by which rare variants are incorporated into the test. Variable thresholds test assumes a fixed yet unknown MAF boundary of rare causal variants, while RareCover does not have the assumption. Still, it does not mean that RareCover would perform exhaustive search for all combinations of variants in a loci region. The \u0026ldquo;coverage\u0026rdquo; of RareCover method depends on the convergence cut-off {$Q$}.\nRareCover method is implemented in this program as a two-sided test with the tuning parameter {$Q=0.5$}, as recommanded by the original paper.\nDetails Command interface vtools show test RareCover Name: RareCover Description: A \u0026quot;covering\u0026quot; method for detecting rare variants association, Bhatia et al 2010. usage: vtools associate --method RareCover [-h] [--name NAME] [-q1 MAFUPPER] [-q2 MAFLOWER] [-p N] [--adaptive C] [--moi {additive,dominant,recessive}] A \u0026quot;covering\u0026quot; method for detecting rare variants association, Bhatia et al 2010.

The default parameter of this command is 'project'. items Items to display, which can be, for example, name of table for type 'table', conditions to select samples for type 'samples', a list of phenotypes for type 'phenotypes', name of an annotation database for type 'annotation', a pattern to selected annotation databases for type 'annotations', name of a format for type 'format', and name of an association test for type 'test'. optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit -l N, --limit N Limit output to the first N records. -v {0,1,2,3}, --verbosity {0,1,2,3} Output error and warning (0), info (1), debug (2) and trace (3) information to standard output (default to 1).  Details Command `vtools show displays various project and system information. It accepts type of item to display as its first parameter, followed by names of items if information about particular items are needed. Generally speaking:\n plural form of output type (e.g. tables, tests) lists all available items. Options are usually available to limit the items to display. single form of output type (e.g. table, test) list details of a single item. The verbosity level can be used to adjust output. For example, -v0 can usually be used to suppress description of items, and -v2 can be used to show more information.  Show project (project) Command `vtools show without parameter and `vtools show project displays general information about a project, including project name, reference genome, existing variant tables, and used annotation databases.\n Examples: Show summary of a downloaded project\nLet us load a fairly large project from an online snapshot vt_ExomeAssociation,\n% vtools init show % vtools admin --load_snapshot vt_ExomeAssociation Downloading snapshot vt_ExomeAssociation.tar.gz from online INFO: Load genotypes INFO: Snapshot vt_ExomeAssociation has been loaded % vtools show Project name: show Primary reference genome: hg19 Secondary reference genome: None Runtime options: verbosity=1 Variant tables: rare variant Annotation databases:  The project has 2 variant tables, the master variant table and another variant tables rare. It uses the hg19 reference genome, and has not been connected to any annotation database.\n\nShow variant and other tables (tables and table) Command vtools show tables lists all variant tables, their creation dates and comments (if available). This command does not accept any additional parameter.\n Examples: Show all variant tables \n% vtools show tables table #variants date message rare 19,785 Jan24 rare variants variant 26,797  \nvtools show tables lists all variant tables of a project, with creation date and comment. If you only need to know information about a particular variant table, it is easier and faster to use command vtools show table TABLE. This command lists date of creation, a short description, number of variants and fields (only the master variant table has multiple fields). Perhaps more interestingly, it shows the command that has been used to create this variant table, which usually contain import information regarding from which table this table is drawn, and what criteria has been used.\n Examples: Show details of a variant table Show details of a table rare, note that you can specify multiple tables after command vtools show table.\n% vtools show table rare Name: rare Type: variant Description: rare variants Creation date: Jan24 Command: vtools select variant 'af\u0026lt;0.01 OR af\u0026gt;0.99' -t rare 'rare variants' Fields: variant_id Number of variants: 19785  \nShow samples (samples) Command vtools show samples lists samples, files from which samples are imported, and phenotypes associated with each samples. The command by default lists all samples and phenotypes, but you can list part of the information by\n Option --limit limit the output to the first few records Option --samples can limit the samples to those that match specified criteria Option -v 0 (--verbosity 0) supress phenotypes. This is useful when there are a large number of phenotypes Option -v 2 lists full filenames. The default output lists part of the filenames if they are too long. Increasing verbosity level will show complete information.   Examples: Show all or selected samples, with or without phenotype Show all samples:\n% vtools show samples -l 10 sample_name filename gender age bmi status exposure SAMP10 assoctest.dat 1 44 27.93818994 0 0 SAMP100 assoctest.dat 1 47 33.47268746 0 0 SAMP1000 assoctest.dat 1 50 26.4845 0 0 SAMP1001 assoctest.dat 2 59 24.02405 0 1 SAMP1002 assoctest.dat 2 61 26.32636 0 0 SAMP1003 assoctest.dat 1 49 24.4131 0 1 SAMP1004 assoctest.dat 1 57 30.57549 0 0 SAMP1005 assoctest.dat 2 57 28.40909 0 1 SAMP1006 assoctest.dat 2 48 28.7642 0 0 SAMP1007 assoctest.dat 1 65 24.14179 0 0 (3170 records omitted)  Show only male samples using condition gender=1 to select samples\n% vtools show samples 'gender=1' -l 10 sample_name filename gender age bmi status exposure SAMP10 assoctest.dat 1 44 27.93818994 0 0 SAMP100 assoctest.dat 1 47 33.47268746 0 0 SAMP1000 assoctest.dat 1 50 26.4845 0 0 SAMP1003 assoctest.dat 1 49 24.4131 0 1 SAMP1004 assoctest.dat 1 57 30.57549 0 0 SAMP1007 assoctest.dat 1 65 24.14179 0 0 SAMP1008 assoctest.dat 1 48 28.20037 0 1 SAMP1010 assoctest.dat 1 56 23.67424 0 1 SAMP1014 assoctest.dat 1 47 23.54056 0 0 SAMP1016 assoctest.dat 1 60 23.8961 0 0 (3170 records omitted)  Suppressing phenotypes and only show basic sample information\n% vtools show samples -l 10 -v0 sample_name filename SAMP10 assoctest.dat SAMP100 assoctest.dat SAMP1000 assoctest.dat SAMP1001 assoctest.dat SAMP1002 assoctest.dat SAMP1003 assoctest.dat SAMP1004 assoctest.dat SAMP1005 assoctest.dat SAMP1006 assoctest.dat SAMP1007 assoctest.dat (3170 records omitted)  \nShow all or selected phenotypes (phenotypes) Command vtools show phenotypes is similar to vtools show samples but it does not show filename information and can display only specified phenotypes.\n Examples: Show all or selected phenotypes Show all phenotypes\n% vtools show phenotypes -l 10 sample_name gender age bmi status exposure SAMP10 1 44 27.93818994 0 0 SAMP100 1 47 33.47268746 0 0 SAMP1000 1 50 26.4845 0 0 SAMP1001 2 59 24.02405 0 1 SAMP1002 2 61 26.32636 0 0 SAMP1003 1 49 24.4131 0 1 SAMP1004 1 57 30.57549 0 0 SAMP1005 2 57 28.40909 0 1 SAMP1006 2 48 28.7642 0 0 SAMP1007 1 65 24.14179 0 0 (3170 records omitted)  Show values of specified phenotypes\n% vtools show phenotypes exposure -l 10 sample_name exposure SAMP10 0 SAMP100 0 SAMP1000 0 SAMP1001 1 SAMP1002 0 SAMP1003 1 SAMP1004 0 SAMP1005 1 SAMP1006 0 SAMP1007 0 (3170 records omitted)  \nAnother command vtools phenotype --output can also output selected phenotypes. It is more powerful in that it has better control of the format of output, and more importantly, allow output of summary statistics of phenotypes.\nShow genotype information for each sample (genotypes) Command vtools show genotypes shows the number of genotypes and names of genotype info fields of each sample. Such information are useful for the calculation of summary statistics of genotypes (e.g. depth of coverage) using commandsvtools phenotype \u0026ndash;from_stat(statistics for each sample) andvtools update \u0026ndash;from_stat@@ (statistics for each variant).\n Examples: Show details of genotypes\n% vtools show genotypes -l 10 sample_name filename num_genotypes sample_genotype_fields SAMP2 assoctest.dat 26612 GT SAMP3 assoctest.dat 26613 GT SAMP4 assoctest.dat 26600 GT SAMP5 assoctest.dat 26600 GT SAMP6 assoctest.dat 26603 GT SAMP7 assoctest.dat 26584 GT SAMP8 assoctest.dat 26612 GT SAMP9 assoctest.dat 26585 GT SAMP10 assoctest.dat 26613 GT SAMP11 assoctest.dat 26588 GT (3170 records omitted)  \nShow variant info and annotation fields (fields) Command vtools show fields) lists all variant info fields (fields in the master variant table) and annotation fields (fields provided by annotation databases). Although these fields are from different sources, they can be used in the same manner to identify and filter variants (c.f. vtools select). If you only need to see a list of available fields, you can use option -v0 to suppress comments.\n Examples: Show all variant info and annotation fields This project uses annotation database knownGene so all fields from that database are available in the project:\n% vtools show fields variant.chr variant.pos variant.ref variant.alt variant.cnt variant.hom variant.het variant.other variant.num variant.missing variant.wtGT variant.mutGT variant.af knownGene.name Name of gene such as uc001aaa.3 knownGene.chr knownGene.strand which DNA strand contains the observed alleles knownGene.txStart Transcription start position knownGene.txEnd Transcription end position knownGene.cdsStart Coding region start knownGene.cdsEnd Coding region end knownGene.exonCount Number of exons  You can use option -v0 to suppress comments (which can be long):\n% vtools show fields -v0 variant.chr variant.pos variant.ref variant.alt variant.cnt variant.hom variant.het variant.other variant.num variant.missing variant.wtGT variant.mutGT variant.af knownGene.name knownGene.chr knownGene.strand knownGene.txStart knownGene.txEnd knownGene.cdsStart knownGene.cdsEnd knownGene.exonCount  \nShow annotation databases (annotations and annotation) Command vtools show annotations displays all available annotation databases with their descriptions. Because of the growing number of annotation databases, the output of this command can be very long. You can however\n Limit the databases by specifying a number of patterns. A database is eligible if its name contains any of the patterns. Use option --limit to limit the number of annotation database displayed, or Use option -v 0 to suppress descriptions of databases.   Examples: Show all annotation databases Show all annotation databases. With this command, variant tools connects to its ftp server and list all available annotation databases.\n% vtools show annotations | head -50 CancerGeneCensus-20111215 Cancer Genome Project CancerGeneCensus-20120315 Cancer Genome Project CancerGeneCensus Cancer Genome Project CosmicCodingMuts-v61_260912 Cosmic coding mutation database.

qual scores that exceed the specified value, and with specified TAG.  \nThe header of BAM track provides many important information about the bam file. You should consult the SAM format specification for the meaning of them, but briefly:\n HD - header: VN is for file format version, SO for sort order, which can be unsorted, queryname or coordinate. SQ - Sequence dictionary: SN is sequence name, @LNis sequence length. This might repeat the chromome length information listed below.ASreference genome used for assembly,SP@@ for species. RG - Read group: ID for read group identifier, SM for sample, LB for library, DS for description, PU for platform unit, DT for date the run was produced, PL for platform (e.g. illumina). PG - Program: ID for program name, VN for program version, CL for command line. CO - Comment  The tags are also important if you need to filter reads by tag values. For example, RG can be used to differentiate reads that belong to different samples if the bam file contains reads from multiple samples.\nShow supported input and output file formats (formats and format) variant tools repository has a number of file format description files .fmt that defines a formats of files that can be used for commands vtools import, vtools update --from_file, and vtools export. To get a complete list of supported file formats, you can use command vtools show formats. Options -v0 and --limit are supported to suppress comment and limit number of formats to display, respectively.\n Examples: Show a list of supported input/output file formats Command vtools show formats display a long list of file formats that are supported by variant tools:\n% vtools show formats | head -50 CASAVA18_snps Input format illumina snps.txt file, created by CASAVA version 1.8 (http://www.illumina.com/support/documentation.ilmn). This format imports chr, pos, ref, alt of most likely genotype, and a Q score for the most likely genotype. plink Input format for PLINK dataset. Currently only PLINK binary PED file format is supported (*.bed, *.bim \u0026amp; *.fam) ANNOVAR Input format of ANNOVAR. No genotype is defined. pileup_indel Input format for samtools pileup indel caller. This format imports chr, pos, ref, alt and genotype.

This format imports chr, pos, ref, alt of only variants that have been fully called and are not equals to ref. (E.g. records with zygosity equal to no-call and half, and varType equal to ref are discarded.) map This input format imports variants from files in MAP format (with columns chr, name gen_dist, pos), or any delimiter-separated format with columns chr and pos. Because these input files do not contain reference and alternative alleles of variants, this format queries such information from the dbSNP database using chr and pos. Records that does not exist in dbSNP will be discarded. Records with multiple alternative alleles will lead to multiple records. polyphen2 To be used to export variants in a format that is acceptable by the polyphen2 server http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/bgi.shtml, and to import the FULL report returned by this server. basic A basic variant input format with four columns: chr, pos, ref, alt. vcf Import vcf  Comments can be suppressed using option -v0,\n% vtools show formats -v0 CASAVA18_snps plink ANNOVAR pileup_indel ANNOVAR_exonic_variant_function ANNOVAR_variant_function CGA map polyphen2 basic vcf CASAVA18_indels csv tped  \nYou can use command vtools show format FMT to list the details of a format. Note that\n Columns are used to direct output. If no column is specified, the format cannot be used for command vtools export. A input file format can have type variant, position, and range. Command vtools import can only import data from variant-based files (because it imports variants). In comparison, command vtools update can update existing variant using all three types of input files. Format options can be used to customized how to import/export data using the format.   Examples: Show details of a format If you would like to know the details of one specific format, you can use command vtools show format FORMAT,\n% vtools show format map Format: map Description: This input format imports variants from files in MAP format (with columns chr, name gen_dist, pos), or any delimiter-separated format with columns chr and pos. Because these input files do not contain reference and alternative alleles of variants, this format queries such information from the dbSNP database using chr and pos. Records that does not exist in dbSNP will be discarded. Records with multiple alternative alleles will lead to multiple records. Columns: None defined, cannot export to this format variant: chr Chromosome pos 1-based position ref Reference allele, '-' for insertion. alt Alternative allele obtained from another database Format parameters: db_file (default: dbSNP.DB) pos_idx Index of column for pyhysical location in the map file, should be 4 for a standard map file with chr, pos, gen_dist, pos. (default: 4) ref_field Name of ref field from the annotation database, used to retrieve reference allele at specified location. (default: refNCBI) alt_field Name of alt field from the annotation database, used to retrieve alternative allele at specified location. (default: alt) chr_field Name of chr field from the annotation database, used to locate variants from the dbSNP database. (default: chr) pos_field Name of pos field from the annotation database, used to locate variants from the dbSNP database. (default: start) separator Separator of the input file, default to space or tab. (default: None)  \nShow association tests (tests and test) Command vtools show tests shows a list of association tests that can be used in command vtools associate. Similar to other commands, option -v0 and --limit can be used to suppress description of tests and limit the number of tests to display.\n Examples: Show a list of supported association tests List all available association tests.\n% vtools show tests BurdenBt Burden test for disease traits, Morris \u0026amp; Zeggini 2009 BurdenQt Burden test for quantitative traits, Morris \u0026amp; Zeggini 2009 CFisher Fisher's exact test on collapsed variant loci, Li \u0026amp; Leal 2008 Calpha c-alpha test for unusual distribution of variants between cases and controls, Neale et al 2011 CollapseBt Collapsing method for disease traits, Li \u0026amp; Leal 2008 CollapseQt Collapsing method for quantitative traits, Li \u0026amp; Leal 2008 GroupStat Calculates basic statistics for each testing group GroupWrite Write data to disk for each testing group KBAC Kernel Based Adaptive Clustering method, Liu \u0026amp; Leal 2010 LinRegBurden A versatile framework of association tests for quantitative traits LogitRegBurden A versatile framework of association tests for disease traits RBT Replication Based Test for protective and deleterious variants, Ionita-Laza et al 2011 RTest A general framework for association analysis using R programs RareCover A \u0026quot;covering\u0026quot; method for detecting rare variants association, Bhatia et al 2010.

If --group_by option is specified, it will collapse the variants within a group into a generic genotype score optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit --name NAME Name of the test that will be appended to names of output fields, usually used to differentiate output of different tests, or the same test with different parameters. -q1 MAFUPPER, --mafupper MAFUPPER Minor allele frequency upper limit. All variants having sample MAF\u0026lt;=m1 will be included in analysis. Default set to 1.0 -q2 MAFLOWER, --maflower MAFLOWER Minor allele frequency lower limit. All variants having sample MAF\u0026gt;m2 will be included in analysis. Default set to 0.0 --alternative TAILED Alternative hypothesis is one-sided (\u0026quot;1\u0026quot;) or two-sided (\u0026quot;2\u0026quot;). Default set to 1 --use_indicator This option, if evoked, will apply binary coding to genotype groups (coding will be \u0026quot;1\u0026quot; if ANY locus in the group has the alternative allele, \u0026quot;0\u0026quot; otherwise) -p N, --permutations N Number of permutations --permute_by XY Permute phenotypes (\u0026quot;Y\u0026quot;) or genotypes (\u0026quot;X\u0026quot;). Default is \u0026quot;Y\u0026quot; --adaptive C Adaptive permutation using Edwin Wilson 95 percent confidence interval for binomial distribution. The program will compute a p-value every 1000 permutations and compare the lower bound of the 95 percent CI of p-value against \u0026quot;C\u0026quot;, and quit permutations with the p-value if it is larger than \u0026quot;C\u0026quot;. It is recommended to specify a \u0026quot;C\u0026quot; that is slightly larger than the significance level for the study. To disable the adaptive procedure, set C=1. Default is C=0.1 --variable_thresholds This option, if evoked, will apply variable thresholds method to the permutation routine in burden test on aggregated variant loci --extern_weight [EXTERN_WEIGHT [EXTERN_WEIGHT ...]] External weights that will be directly applied to genotype coding. Names of these weights should be in one of '--var_info' or '--geno_info'. If multiple weights are specified, they will be applied to genotypes sequentially. Note that all weights will be masked if --use_indicator is evoked. --weight {Browning_all,Browning,KBAC,RBT} Internal weighting themes inspired by various association methods. Valid choices are: 'Browning_all', 'Browning', 'KBAC' and 'RBT'. Except for 'Browning_all' weighting, tests using all other weighting themes has to calculate p-value via permutation. For details of the weighting themes, please refer to the online documentation. --NA_adjust This option, if evoked, will replace missing genotype values with a score relative to sample allele frequencies. The association test will be adjusted to incorporate the information. This is an effective approach to control for type I error due to differential degrees of missing genotypes among samples. --moi {additive,dominant,recessive} Mode of inheritance. Will code genotypes as 0/1/2/NA for additive mode, 0/1/NA for dominant or recessive mode. Default set to additive  \nShow currently available snapshots (snapshots and snapshot) You can save snapshots of the current project and revert to them later. This allows you to recover a project when it is damaged by wrong operations or system failure, and more importantly, allows you to explore different processing pipelines with a saved baseline stage. The command vtools show snapshots lists information about all snapshots. Names starting with vt_ are online snapshots that will be downloaded automatically using command vtools admin --load_snapshot NAME. These snapshots contain sample projects and data and are ideal for learning variant tools.\nNote that:\n Project-specific snapshots are stored under the project cache directory and are listed by command vtools show snapshots. Snapshots saved locally (use a filename with vtools admin --save_snapshot) can be saved in any directory and will not be listed by command vtools show snapshots. Command vtools show snapshot FILENAME can be used to show details of such snapshots.   Examples: Show a list of local and online snapshots\n% vtools show snapshots vt_qc snapshot for QC tutorial, exome data of 1000 genomes project with simulated GD and GQ scores (online snapshot) vt_ExomeAssociation Data with ~26k variants from chr1 and 2, ~3k samples, 3 phenotypes, ready for association testing.

You can use command vtools show runtime_options to get the name and description of these options. If you simply need to see a list of options, you can pass option -v0 to suppress descriptions. Please see command vtools admin --set_runtime_option for details.\n Examples: Show a list of runtime options\n% vtools show runtime_options | head -50 associate_num_of_readers None (default) Use specified number of processes to read genotype data for association tests. The default value is the minimum of value of option --jobs and 8. Note that a large number of reading processes might lead to degraded performance or errors due to disk access limits. association_timeout None (default) Cancel associate test and return special values when a test lasts more than specified time (in seconds). The default value of this option is None, which stands for no time limit. import_num_of_readers 2 (default) variant tools by default uses two processes to read from input files during multi-process importing (--jobs \u0026gt; 0). You can want to set it to zero if a single process provides better performance or reduces disk traffic. local_resource ~/.variant_tools (default) A directory to store variant tools related resources such as reference genomes and annotation database. Files under this directory is usually downloaded automatically upon use, but can also be synchronized directly from http://vtools.houstonbioinformatics.org/. logfile_verbosity 2 (default) Verbosity level of the log file, can be 0 for warning and error only, 1 for general information, or 2 for general and debug information. search_path .;http://vtools.houstonbioinformatics.org/ (default) A ;-separated list of directories and URLs that are used to locate annotation database (.ann, .DB), file format (.fmt) and other files. Reset this option allows alternative local or online storage of such files. variant tools will append trailing directories such as annoDB for certain types of data so only root directories should be listed in this search path. sqlite_pragma (default) pragmas for sqlite database that can be used to optimize the performance of database operations. temp_dir None (default) Use the specified temporary directory to store temporary files to improve performance (use separate disks for project and temp files), or avoid problems due to insufficient disk space. treat_missing_as_wildtype False (default) Treat missing values as wildtype alleles for association tests. This option is used when samples are called individuals or in batch so genotypes for some samples are ignored and treated as missing if  to see a list of runtime options, use command\n% vtools show runtime_options -v0 associate_num_of_readers association_timeout import_num_of_readers local_resource logfile_verbosity search_path sqlite_pragma temp_dir treat_missing_as_wildtype verbosity  Furthermore, if you only need to check the exiting value of a runtime option, you can use command vtools show runtime_option OPT,\n% vtools show runtime_option local_resource ~/.variant_tools  (:exampleend\n"

	"content": " Specification of external file formats Roles of format specification in variant tools: Variant tools can import and export text files (or gzipped text files) in delimiter-separated format, namely records that are separated into columns by delimiters such as tab, space or comma. The file format must be variant-oriented (storing one or more variants by line), with the exception of sample-based PLINK format which is preprocessed internally into variant-oriented form for import. We use terms\n column for columns (text) in a delimiter-separated file, and field for fields (with types) in tables in a database, with  variant fields for fields that define variants (chr, pos, ref, alt), variant info for fields that annotate variants (e.g. membership to dbSNP), genotype fields for fields to store genotypes of samples, and genotype info for fields that annotate genotypes (e.g. quality score of each genotype)   A format specification defines how to extract fields from columns and how to write columns from fields, to\n Insert new variants to the project using command vtools import. The text file should provide at least four fields for chromosome, position, reference and alternative alleles. In addition to variant and variant info, an input file can contain genotype and genotype info for one or more samples.  The four fields could, but not necessarily have to, be in four columns because a field could be synthesized from multiple columns, even not from any existing column. For example, if all variants are from dbSNP, ref and alt fields could be looked up from a dbSNP annotation database.\n Update existing variants with additional info using command vtools update. The text files can have\n full variant information (chr, pos, ref and alt) to update matching variants and related genotypes and their info, or\n chromosomal positions (chr and pos) to update all variants at specified locations, or\n range (chr, start, end) to update variants in specified regions\n  Export samples and their variants using command vtools export. The file format should be organized by variant (not by sample). Although each line of the output file usually present a variant (chr, pos, ref, alt), it can contain multiple variants at a locus (chr, pos, ref, mutliple alternative alleles), or only locus-specific information (chr, pos).\n  The format specification file (.fmt file) A .fmt file describes the format of an external file so that it can be handled by variant tools. An format specification file follows an extended .ini format with section and key/value pairs. Details of this format can be found at this link because it is parsed by a Python ConfigParser object. This file should have at least a [format description] section and a few field sections. A format specification could be used to import and export files but you can ignore import or export specifications if you are only interested in exporting or importing.\nSection [format description] This section should have keys\n description: a description of the format, with preferably a URL to the documentation of the format.\n encoding (optional): encoding of the input file. If you see errors such as \u0026quot;codec can't decode byte 0xe7 in position 21480\u0026quot;, you should perhaps add encoding=ISO-8859-1 to your .fmt file.\n delimiter (optional): delimiter to define columns in the input file. Default to tab (delimiter='\\t'). If your input can be either tab or space delimited, use delimiter=None if your input does not have any missing field because '\\t\\t' or ' ' will be treated as a single delimiter. Quotations around other delimiters can be ignored (e.g. , instead of ',').\n header (optional): variant tools by default treats lines with a leading # as header and skip them during data importing. The header will also be used to probe sample names for some formats (e.g. .vcf). If your input file does not use such a header, you can override this behavior by specifying the number of lines to skip (header=1), or a pattern by which headers are matched (e.g. use header=^%.* for header lines starting with %, see documents of the Python re package for details).\n preprocessor (optional): a functor to pre-process input data into some intermediate format that can be readily imported by variant tools (e.g., PlinkConverter())\n export_by (optional, for export only): How variants at the same locus are exported. By default, variant tools exports one line for each variant. If fields specified by export_by (e.g. chr, pos) cannot uniquely identify variants so multiple variants will be outputted in one line, values at extra records will be ignored, or be collapsed to the first record if supported by column specification.\n sort_output_by (optional, for export only): How variants are ordered. This option is ignored if export_by is defined.\n  THIS OPTION IS CURRENTLY NOT USED\n merge_by (optional, for import only): If genotype at different homozygous copies (ploidy) is recorded in separate lines, this option has to be used to specify the columns to uniquely identify a variant. These columns will be passed to the processor without modification, values at all other columns are merged (separated by \u0026lsquo;,\u0026rsquo;).\n One of\n variant: fields for chr, pos, ref, and alt. Such input files have complete variant information and can be used to add new variants or add or update info of existing variants.\n position: fields for chr and pos for chromosomal positions.\n range: fields for chr, start and end positions of regions.\n   input files of the latter two types can only be used to update matching variants with additional variant_info.\n variant_info (optional): Additional fields that will be inserted to specified variant table.\n genotype (optional): name of a field that will be imported into the sample variant table. Using a slice-index syntax, this field can process genotypes for multiple samples (e.g. index=8: will produce genotypes from columns 8, 9, \u0026hellip;). The return value of this field must be value 1 for heterozygote, 2 for homozygote, and -1 for double heterozygote (alt1, alt2).\n genotype_info (optional): Fields such as quality score that will be appended to genotype of each sample. They should either generate a single value for all samples (regular index), or a different value for each sample (slice-index).\n  General speaking, genotype info fields are sample specific so different samples can have different values for the same variant. Variant info fields are supposed to be properties of variants and are shared by all (or part of the) samples. It is up to the user (and file format) to decide how to handle particular fields from input files.\nSection [DEFAULT] (define parameters of a format) The default section defines values that exist, conceptually, in all sections. It is used to define parameters used for import or export. These parameters could be overriden using corresponding command line option. For example, in the following .fmt file (partial)\n[format description] description=Output from ANNOVAR, generated from command \u0026quot;path/to/annovar/annotate_variation.pl annovar.txt path/to/annovar/humandb/\u0026quot;. This format imports chr, pos, ref, alt and ANNOVAR annotations. For details please refer to http://www.openbioinformatics.org/annovar/annovar_gene.html variant=chr, pos, ref, alt variant_info=%(var_info)s [DEFAULT] var_info=mut_type var_info_comment=Fields to be outputted, can be one or both of mut_type and function  The key var_info has a help message defined by parameter var_info_comment, and a default value mut_type. If you query the details of this format using command\n% vtools show format ANNOVAR_output  you will see at the end of the output the following description:\nOther fields (usable through parameters): function the gene name, the transcript identifier and the sequence change in the corresponding transcript Format parameters: var_info Fields to be outputted, can be one or both of mut_type and function. (default: mut_type)  This means you can pass an alternative value of var_info to this format using parameters such as --var_info function to change the variant information field to be imported or updated. For example, you can use command\n% vtools update variant input_file --format ANNOVAR_output --var_info mut_type function  to update two fields mut_type and function instead of the default one (mut_type).\nName of a variable cannot be any keyword (e.g. field, comment, adj, type) or start with fmt_.\nField sections (import: how to extract fields from input file) Import fields sections describe the fields that can be imported if they appear in one of variant, position, range, variant_info, genotype and genotype_info. Because the value of these fields could be overridden using corresponding parameters of command vtools import, a .fmt file might define additional or alternative fields to provide alternative ways to import data in this format.\nEach field section can have the following keys:\n index: index(es) of field, which can be\n A 1-based index of the column in the input file. The value at this column will be used for this field.\n A tuple syntax with multiple indexes separated by ',', for example 5,7. A list of values at specified columns will be passed to an adjust function to produce values of the field.\n A \u0026lsquo;slice\u0026rsquo; syntax to specify multiple fields. This syntax will only be used for genotype and genotype information fields. For example, index=8: will produce multiple fields from columns 8, 9, ... till end of the columns. Other examples include index=8::2 for 8, 10, 12, ..., index=5,8: for (5,8), (5,9), \u0026hellip;, and index=8::2,9::2 for (8,9), (10,11), etc\n  type: can be any SQL allowed types such as \u0026ldquo;INTEGER\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;FLOAT\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;INTEGER NOT NULL\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;DECIMAL(7,6) NOT NULL\u0026rdquo;\n comment (optional) a description of the field\n adj (optional): Functions or functors to extract or modify one or more values from the field value. variant tools provides a number of functors to help the processing of different fields. For example,\n IncreaseBy(inc=1) (increase value by inc). This is usually used to adjust 0-based position to 1-based position that is used by variant tools.\n MapValue(map) (map value to another). This function is used to map input value to another one, for example, MapValue({'het': '1', 'hom': '2'}) maps value \u0026lsquo;het\u0026rsquo; to \u0026lsquo;1\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;hom\u0026rsquo; to \u0026lsquo;2\u0026rsquo;. Note that the mapped values should be strings or None.\n Nullify(val) (treat value as NULL). This is usually used to adjust input NA values to NULL in the database.\n RemoveLeading(val) (remove leading characters). This is usually used to remove leading chr from inputs with chromosomes such as chr1, chr2, because variant tools only stores 1, 2, etc.\n ExtractField(index, sep=';', default=None) (field of a column): Split the item by sep and return the index-th field (1-based). Return default if there are less than index fields. For example, ExtractField(2, ':') extracts 20 from 10:20:30.\n  Multiple functors/functions can be used sequentially. For example, ExtractValue('CEU:'), ExtractField(1, '/') extracts value 12 from YRI:20/222;CEU:12/45 (the first extractor gets 12/45, the second extractor gets 12), and ExtractValue('CEU:'), SplitField('/') extracts values 12 and 45 from YRI:20/222;CEU:12/45.\n If none of the provided extractors can be used, you can define your own function. For example, lambda x: x[6:].replace(\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;\u0026quot;) extracts 24000 from COUNT=24,000. You can also mix function with variant tools provided extractor ExtractValue(\u0026quot;COUNT=\u0026quot;), lambda x: x.replace(\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;\u0026quot;)]) to extract 24000 from values such as ASD;COUNT=24,000;MAF=0.5.\n If the return value of at least one of the fields is a tuple of more than one values (e.g. result from functor SplitField), multiple records will be generated from this line. Non-tuple values of other fields will be copied automatically. For example, if three fields have values A1, (B1,), (C1, C2), they will produce two records of A1, B1, C1 and A1, None, C2.\n If you would like to exclude certain records, you can use adj to produce invalid records that will be excluded during importing. For example, a record with None alternative allele, or a field with NOT NULL type will be ignored, or a genotype with None mutation type will be ignored.\n  Section [Field formatter] (export: how to format fields for output) This section specifies how to format fields when they are outputted to a file. Fields that are not listed in this section will be converted to string directly, unless a special wildcast formatter fmt_* is specified. This section should look like\n[Field formatter] fmt_chr=Prepend('chr') fmt_freq=Formatter('{.3f}') fmt_id=ValueOfNull('.') fmt_other=lambda x: something  The name of the formatter should be field name prepended by fmt_. Formatter for each field should be a functor or a function. Their return value must be a string. More interestingly, multiple fields could be formatted altogether so it is possible to specify\nfmt_PL1,fmt_PL2,fmt_PL3=lambda x: x[0] + x[1] + x[2]  to create a single string from multiple fields.\nColumn sections (export: how to organize fields into columns of output file) Export reverses the import process. Instead of extracting fields from one or more columns, it generates columns from one or more fields. Column sections have title col_# where # is the index of column. They are specified in a similar way to fields. File formats without column specification cannot be used to export variants and samples.\nEach column section can have the following keys:\n field: name of field or fields that will be used to create a column. The fields are usually defined in this .fmt file. If a field specifies genotype or genotype information of more than one sample using a slice syntax, multiple columns will be generated. If multiple records are collapsed into a single record(c.f. export_by), a tuple of values will be passed to the adj function/functor if it is defined. Otherwise, only the first record will be exported.\n adj: function or functor that accepts values at one or more fields and produce a single value at this column.\n comment (optional) a description of the column\n  The basic steps of outputting a file is to collect values of all fields, apply formatters to each field (or groups of fields) if available, and collect results to columns. Note that\n Although fields of columns are usually the ones that are defined in a .fmt file, arbitrary fields could be outputted if fields of a column are configurable through parameters.\n A column is considered as a genotype column if it contains field GT. Multiple columns will be exported if genotypes of multiple samples are outputted.\n A field can generate multiple columns by using a formatter that returns, for example, \u0026lsquo;1,2\u0026rsquo; for a comma-separated format.\n  Import and test After a file is created, you can use command\nvtools import --format /path/to/fmt_file input_file --build specified_build  to import your file, and use command\nvtools show table variant -l -1  to check if variants are correctly imported. If you believe that your format is commonly used, please send the .fmt file to our mailinglist. We will post the file to the repository so that others can make use of it.\nExamples You can learn from the system format files on how to define a format:\n A basic example of a format with variant fields: ANNOVAR format. An example of using lambda functions to extract information from multiple columns: snps.txt created by CASAVA 1.8.  You can have a look at system format files using\nvtools show formats vtools show format SOME_FORMAT more cache/SOME_FORMAT.fmt  The first command gets a list of supported formats. The second command gets details of a specific format, and the third command lets you view the format file because all used formats are stored in a temporary directory named cache under your project folder.\n"

If the variant is a SNV, the output merely connects input by tab (\u0026rsquo;\\t\u0026rsquo;). If the variant is an indel, it will pad reference (for insertion) or alternative (for deletion) allele with the allele before variant, adjust position, and generate an output that is acceptable by vcf.

The American Journal of Human Genetics doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2010.04.005. http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0002929710002077^]) tests for association between phenotypic values (case control or quantitative traits) with individuals\u0026rsquo; genotype \u0026ldquo;score\u0026rdquo; subject to a variable MAF threshold. It assumes that there exists a fixed yet unknown MAF threshold on a given genetic region which is related to the cutoff for the causality of variants on that loci. In testing the association for the genetic region, for each possible MAF threshold a genotype score is computed based on given collapsing theme, and is tested for association between the phenotype of interest; the final MAF threshold is chosen such that the association signal is strongest. Permutation procedure has to be used to control for type I error due to multiple testing.\nThe VT strategy creates a very flexible framework that can be applied to many association tests, including the use of external information such as weight theme by annotation scores, as the VT paper suggested. The VTtest method implements the test for case control phenotype using the CMC coding theme and Fisher\u0026rsquo;s exact test, in addition to the original VT statistic. Permutation procedure is optimized due to the use of Fisher\u0026rsquo;s exact test: the minimum {$p$} value resulted from Fisher\u0026rsquo;s exact test on the original dataset have to exceed the expected significance level in order to enter the permutation test procedure; otherwise it will be reported as it is. This trick reduces the computation time the original VT test would require.\nPlease refer to VariableThresholdsBt and VariableThresholdsQt for more versatile versions of VT method, which tests for both case control and quantitative traits, with/without presence of phenotype co-variates, and is capable of incorporating functional information.\nDetails Command interface vtools show test VTtest Name: VTtest Description: VT statistic for disease traits, Price et al 2010 usage: vtools associate --method VTtest [-h] [--name NAME] [-q1 MAFUPPER] [-q2 MAFLOWER] [--alternative TAILED] [-p N] [--adaptive C] [--cfisher] [--midp] [--moi {additive,dominant,recessive}] Variable thresholds test for disease traits, Price et al 2010. The burden test statistic of a group of variants will be maximized over subsets of variants defined by applying different minor allele frequency thresholds. This implementation provides two different statistics: the original VT statistics in Price et al 2010 (default) and an adaptive VT statistic combining the CFisher method (via \u0026quot;--cfisher\u0026quot; option). p-value is estimated by permutation test. The adaptive VT statistic will not generate uniformly distributed p-value. For a more generalized version of VT test, type \u0026quot;vtools show test VariableThresholdsBt / VariableThresholdsQt\u0026quot;. optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit --name NAME Name of the test that will be appended to names of output fields, usually used to differentiate output of different tests, or the same test with different parameters. -q1 MAFUPPER, --mafupper MAFUPPER Minor allele frequency upper limit. All variants having sample MAF\u0026lt;=m1 will be included in analysis. Default set to 1.0 -q2 MAFLOWER, --maflower MAFLOWER Minor allele frequency lower limit. All variants having sample MAF\u0026gt;m2 will be included in analysis. Default set to 0.0 --alternative TAILED Alternative hypothesis is one-sided (\u0026quot;1\u0026quot;) or two-sided (\u0026quot;2\u0026quot;). Two sided test is only valid with \u0026quot;--cfisher\u0026quot; option evoked (please use \u0026quot;VariableThresholdsBt\u0026quot; otherwise). Default set to 1 -p N, --permutations N Number of permutations --adaptive C Adaptive permutation using Edwin Wilson 95 percent confidence interval for binomial distribution. The program will compute a p-value every 1000 permutations and compare the lower bound of the 95 percent CI of p-value against \u0026quot;C\u0026quot;, and quit permutations with the p-value if it is larger than \u0026quot;C\u0026quot;. It is recommended to specify a \u0026quot;C\u0026quot; that is slightly larger than the significance level for the study. To disable the adaptive procedure, set C=1. Default is C=0.1 --cfisher This option, if evoked, will use an adaptive VT test via Fisher's exact statistic. For more details, please refer to the online documentation. --midp This option, if evoked, will use mid-p value correction for one-sided Fisher's exact test. It is only applicatable to one sided test with \u0026quot;--cfisher\u0026quot; option. --moi {additive,dominant,recessive} Mode of inheritance.

It might contains the casual variant or other associations that are in vicinity (in LD) with the reported gwas hits. Therefore, it make more sense to find variants that are close to the reported gwas hits.\ngwasCatalog: usage as a range-based annotation source The most flexible way to use this annotation source is to link your variants to GWA hits with a position range. The following links your variant positions to GWA hits using variant chromosomal locations that are +/- 5000bp within the GWA hit.\nvtools use gwasCatalog --anno_type range --linked_fields chr position-5000 position+5000  Then you can generate a useful report showing what known gwas hits are near your variants.

Basic link options: --as NAME An alternative name for the linked database. This option allows the use of shorter field names (e.g. tg.chr instead of thousandGenomes.chr) and the use of multiple versions of the same database. -l [LINKED_BY [LINKED_BY ...]], --linked_by [LINKED_BY [LINKED_BY ...]] A list of fields that are used to link the annotation database to tables in the existing project. This parameter is required only for 'field' type of annotation databases that link to fields of existing tables. Advanced link options: --anno_type {variant,position,range,field} This option overrides type of an existing annotation database when it is attached to a project. It corresponds to key anno_type of the data sources section of an annotation file (with suffix .ann) but does not affect the .ann file or the database built from it. --linked_fields [LINKED_FIELDS [LINKED_FIELDS ...]] An alternative set of fields that are used to link the annotation database to the master variant table. It should have four, two, and three values for database of type variant, position, and range. Similar to anno_type, this option does not affect the .ann file or the database built from it. Build database from source: -f [FILES [FILES ...]], --files [FILES [FILES ...]] A list of source files. If specified, vtools will not try to download and select source files. These source files will be compiled into a local annotation database. This is used only when no local annotation database is specified. --rebuild If set, variant tools will always rebuild the annotation database from source, ignoring existing local and online database. In addition to $name.DB, variant tools will also create $name-$version.DB.gz that can be readily distributed. -j N, --jobs N If need to build database from source, maximum number of processes to use.  Details Command vtools use attaches an annotation database to the project, effectively making one or more attributes available to variants in the project. Four types of annotation databases can be used with variant tools:\n A variant annotation database is linked directly to the project by linking chromosome, position, reference and alternative allele to fields chr, pos, ref, and alt of the project. It provides variant-level annotation. A position annotation database is linked to the project using fields chr and pos. It provides annotation information for nucleotide locations. If there are more than one variants at a locus, the annotation information are used for all of them. A range annotation database is linked to the project by comparing fields chr and pos to chromosome, starting and ending positions of each range. It provides annotation information for all variants in chromosomal regions. A field annotation database can be linked to any existing variant info or annotation fields and provide annotation information for these fields. For example, a gene annotation table might provide description for some genes, which can be linked to the project through field refGene.name2 that is provided by database refGene. Because attribute annotation databases are anchored to a project through existing attributes, one or more fields must be specified to link the database to the project using parameter --linked_by.  Basic usages of system-provided annotation databases It is easy to use system-provided annotation databases. Generally speaking, you should\n Use command vtools show annotations to see a list of annotation databases, and identify annotation databases that match the reference genome of your project. Use command vtools show annotation ANNODB to check the details of an annotation database. Use command vtools use ANNODB to download (if needed) and link the database to your project. variant tools will automatically link the project to the database using appropriate fields.\n Position-aware annotation databases (variant, position, and range) are ref-genome dependent. Most such annotation databases are built for a particular build of reference genome, but some of them support multiple reference genomes.\n Newer databases usually contain more updated annotation information and usually use more recent build of reference genome. If you are using hg18 and would like to use annotation databases that use build hg19 of the reference genome, you can liftover your project to add hg19 as an alternative reference genome.\n   Examples: Use system-provided annotation databases Let us get a project\n% vtools init use --parent vt_simple  This project uses build hg19 of the reference genome, as shown in the output of command vtools show\n% vtools show Upgrading to 1.0.7: 100% [==============================] 3 202.2/s in 00:00:00 Project name: test Primary reference genome: hg19 Secondary reference genome: None Runtime options: verbosity=1 Variant tables: variant Annotation databases:  We then use command vtools show annotations to check all available databases, using option -v0 to suppress descriptions of databases:\n% vtools show annotations -v0 CancerGeneCensus-20111215 CancerGeneCensus-20120315 CancerGeneCensus CosmicCodingMuts-v61_260912 CosmicCodingMuts CosmicMutantExport-v61_260912 CosmicMutantExport CosmicNonCodingVariants-v61_260912 CosmicNonCodingVariants ccdsGene-hg19_20110909 ccdsGene-hg19_20111206 ccdsGene ccdsGene_exon-hg19_20110909 ccdsGene_exon-hg19_20111206 ccdsGene_exon ccdsGene_exon_hg19-20111206 ccdsGene_hg19-20111206 cytoBand-hg18_20111216 cytoBand-hg19_20111216 cytoBand dbNSFP-hg18_hg19_1.1_2 dbNSFP-hg18_hg19_1_3 dbNSFP-hg18_hg19_2_0b4 dbNSFP dbNSFP_light-hg18_hg19_1.0_0 dbNSFP_light-hg18_hg19_1_3 dbNSFP_light dbSNP-hg18_129 dbSNP-hg18_130 dbSNP-hg19_131 dbSNP-hg19_132 dbSNP-hg19_135-1 dbSNP-hg19_135 dbSNP-hg19_137 dbSNP evs-6500 evs-hg19_20111107 evs evs_5400 genomicSuperDups-hg19_20130626 genomicSuperDups gwasCatalog-hg19_20111220 gwasCatalog keggPathway-20110823 keggPathway knownGene-hg18_20110909 knownGene-hg18_20121219 knownGene-hg19_20110909 knownGene-hg19_20121219 knownGene knownGene_exon-hg18_20110909 knownGene_exon-hg19_20110909 knownGene_exon phastCons-hg19_20110909 phastCons-hg19_20130322 phastCons phastConsElements-hg19_20130622 phastConsElements refGene-hg18_20110909 refGene-hg19_20110909 refGene refGene_exon-hg18_20110909 refGene_exon-hg19_20110909 refGene_exon thousandGenomes-hg19_20110909 thousandGenomes-hg19_201202 thousandGenomes thousandGenomesEBI-hg19_phase1_release_v3_20101123 thousandGenomesEBI  Some databases uses hg18, but most uses hg19.

For example, dbSNP could be dbSNP-hg19_135, and then dbSNP-hg19_138 after version 138 becomes available. You can use a specific version of a database by specifying its full name. The database will appear without version name in your project (e.g. as dbSNP). You can use the --as option to give databases different names if you would like to use different versions of the same database in the project.  Advanced usages of annotation databases Each database provide a number of fields and one or more default methods to link them to a project database. For example, if you look at the output of vtools show annotation refGene, you can see that this is a range-based database that is linked to a project using fields chr, txStart, and txEnd, which are chromosome name and start and ending of transcription region. The database, however, has other fields such as cdsStart and cdsEnd so you can link the database to a project using these two fields to identify variants in the coding regions of ref seq genes. You can even use regions such as txStart-5000, txEnd+5000 to extend each region by 5k to include variants that are in vicinity of ref seq genes.\n Examples: alternative ways to link range-based annotation databases There are 730 variants in the regular ref seq gene regions,\n% vtools select variant 'refGene.chr is not NULL' -c Counting variants: 13 456.6/s in 00:00:00 730  We can link to the refGene database using coding regions\n% vtools use refGene --linked_fields chr cdsStart cdsEnd INFO: Downloading annotation database from annoDB/refGene.ann INFO: Downloading annotation database from http://vtools.houstonbioinformatics.org/annoDB/refGene-hg19_20110909.DB.gz Binning ranges: 100% [===============================================] 40,843 24.3K/s in 00:00:01 INFO: Using annotation DB refGene in project test.

For example, the gawsCatalog database records is a position-based annotation database that records GWAS hits. Because of the uncertainty of the exact locations of these findings, you can link it to the project as a range-based database that find variants that are close to these GWAS hits.\n Examples: Link a position based database as a range-based database We would like to see if any of our variants has been identified by one of the Genome-wide association studies. gwasCatalog is a position-based database that records all identified variants by their positions.\n% vtools use gwasCatalog INFO: Downloading annotation database from annoDB/gwasCatalog.ann INFO: Downloading annotation database from http://vtools.houstonbioinformatics.org/annoDB/gwasCatalog-hg19_20111220.DB.gz INFO: Using annotation DB gwasCatalog in project test.

For example, the gwasCatalog database has a field region that records the cytoband of each GWAS signal belongs. If you link this field to database cytoBand, you can provide a list of GWAS hits within each cytoband.\n Examples: Use a position-based database as a field database to annotate cytoBand The gwasCatalog database has a field region that records the cytoband of each GWAS hit.

For example if you have a huge amount of data and you do not want to import all of them into a project (to reduce size and improve performance of the main project database), you can create annotation databases from input data.\nThe general process to create an annotation database is\n Write a .ann file that describe your annotation source (http://varianttools.sourceforge.net/Annotation/New). You can usually start from one of the system .ann files under ~/.varianttools/annoDB. Use command vtools use NAME.ann to create an annotation database and use it in the project. You can specify source files using option --files. A option --rebuild will force the rebuild of database from source file and generate a versioned and compressed .DB.gz file.  The anno_utils? pipelines provide a few pipelines that can help you create annotation databases from various resources. For example, if you have a project with variants from unaffected individuals, you can export the variants as an annotation database. This database can be used by other projects to filter variants.\n"

PLoS Genetics doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1000384. http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000384^] first introduced the idea of assigning \u0026ldquo;weights\u0026rdquo; to rare variants within a genetic region before they are collapsed. In this case the variants having higher weights will have more substantial contribution to the collapsed variant score. In the Madsen \u0026amp; Browning paper the \u0026ldquo;weights\u0026rdquo; are defined as {$\\sqrt{n_iq_i(1-q_i)}$} with the assumption that the \u0026ldquo;rarer\u0026rdquo; the variant, the larger the risk effect it is to a phenotype. The {$q_i$} in the original paper was based on observed control sample, which might result in inflated type I error[^Mathieu Lemire (2011) Defining rare variants by their frequencies in controls may increase type I error.

Implementation of the WSS statistic in the WSSRankTest method uses the same definition for {$q_i$} but the Mann-Whitney U test (definition and C++ implementation for this program) now relies on a full permutation procedure rather than normal approximation, such that the bias is correctly accounted for.\nAs with the Varible Thresholds strategy?, the idea of weighting can be applied to many other rare variant methods. The WeightedBurdenBt and WeightedBurdenQt methods implements the Madsen \u0026amp; Browning weighting based on controls (or samples with low quantitative phenotypic values) or the entire population, and tests for association for both case control and quantitative traits with/without presence of phenotype co-variates.\nDetails Command interface vtools show test WSSRankTest Name: WSSRankTest Description: Weighted sum method using rank test statistic, Madsen \u0026amp; Browning 2009 usage: vtools associate --method WSSRankTest [-h] [--name NAME] [-q1 MAFUPPER] [-q2 MAFLOWER] [--alternative TAILED] [-p N] [--adaptive C] [--moi {additive,dominant,recessive}] Weighted sum method using rank test statistic, Madsen \u0026amp; Browning 2009. p-value is based on the significance level of the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Two methods are available for evaluating p-value: a semi-asymptotic p-value based on normal distribution, or permutation based p-value. Variants will be weighted by 1/sqrt(nP*(1-P)) and the weighted codings will be summed up for rank test. Two-sided test is available for the asymptotic version, which will calculate two p-values based on weights from controls and cases respectively, and use the smaller of them with multiple testing adjustment. For two-sided permutation based p-value please refer to \u0026quot;vtools show test WeightedBurdenBt\u0026quot; optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit --name NAME Name of the test that will be appended to names of output fields, usually used to differentiate output of different tests, or the same test with different parameters. -q1 MAFUPPER, --mafupper MAFUPPER Minor allele frequency upper limit.

All variants having sample MAF\u0026gt;m2 will be included in analysis. Default set to 0.0 --alternative TAILED Alternative hypothesis is one-sided (\u0026quot;1\u0026quot;) or two-sided (\u0026quot;2\u0026quot;).

Default is zero --adaptive C Adaptive permutation using Edwin Wilson 95 percent confidence interval for binomial distribution. The program will compute a p-value every 1000 permutations and compare the lower bound of the 95 percent CI of p-value against \u0026quot;C\u0026quot;, and quit permutations with the p-value if it is larger than \u0026quot;C\u0026quot;. It is recommended to specify a \u0026quot;C\u0026quot; that is slightly larger than the significance level for the study. To disable the adaptive procedure, set C=1. Default is C=0.1 --moi {additive,dominant,recessive} Mode of inheritance. Will code genotypes as 0/1/2/NA for additive mode, 0/1/NA for dominant or recessive model.

	"content": " Select variants from a variant table Usage % vtools select -h usage: vtools select [-h] [-s [COND [COND ...]]] [-t [TABLE [DESC ...]]] [-c | -o [FIELDS [FIELDS ...]]] [--header [HEADER [HEADER ...]]] [-d DELIMITER] [--na NA] [-l N] [--build BUILD] [-g [FIELD [FIELD ...]]] [--all] [--order_by FIELD [FIELD ...]] [-v {0,1,2}] from_table [condition [condition ...]] Select variants according to properties (variant and annotation fields) and membership (samples) of variant. The result can be counted, outputted, or saved to a variant table. positional arguments: from_table Source variant table. condition Conditions by which variants are selected. Multiple arguments are automatically joined by 'AND' so 'OR' conditions should be provided by a single argument with conditions joined by 'OR'. If unspecified, all variants (except those excluded by parameter --samples) will be selected. optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit -s [COND [COND ...]], --samples [COND [COND ...]] Limiting variants from samples that match conditions that use columns shown in command 'vtools show sample' (e.g. 'aff=1', 'filename like \u0026quot;MG%\u0026quot;'). -t [TABLE [DESC ...]], --to_table [TABLE [DESC ...]] Destination variant table. -c, --count Output number of variant, which is a shortcut to '-- output count(1)'. -o [FIELDS [FIELDS ...]], --output [FIELDS [FIELDS ...]] A list of fields that will be outputted. SQL- compatible expressions or functions such as \u0026quot;pos-1\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;count(1)\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;sum(num)\u0026quot; are also allowed. -v {0,1,2}, --verbosity {0,1,2} Output error and warning (0), info (1) and debug (2) information to standard output (default to 1). Output options: --header [HEADER [HEADER ...]] A complete header or a list of names that will be joined by a delimiter (parameter --delimiter). If a special name - is specified, the header will be read from the standard input, which is the preferred way to specify large multi-line headers (e.g. cat myheader | vtools export --header -). If this parameter is given without parameter, a default header will be derived from field names. -d DELIMITER, --delimiter DELIMITER Delimiter use to separate columns of output. The default output uses multiple spaces to align columns of output. Use '-d,' for csv output, or -d'\\t' for tab-delimited output. --na NA Output string for missing value -l N, --limit N Limit output to the first N records. --build BUILD Output reference genome. If set to alternative build, chr and pos in the fields will be replaced by alt_chr and alt_pos -g [FIELD [FIELD ...]], --group_by [FIELD [FIELD ...]] Group output by fields. This option is useful for aggregation output where summary statistics are grouped by one or more fields. --all Variant tools by default output only one of the records if a variant matches multiple records in an annotation database. This option tells variant tools to output all matching records. --order_by FIELD [FIELD ...] Order output by specified fields in ascending order, or descending order if field name is followed by DESC (e.g. --order_by 'num DESC')  Details The basic form of command\nvtools select table condition action  selects from a variant table table a subset of variants satisfying given condition, and perform an action of\n creating a new variant table if --to_table is specified. counting the number of variants if --count is specified. outputting selected variants if --output is specified (as if command vtools output is used on it).  The condition should be a SQL expression using one or more fields in the project (shown in vtools show fields). If the condition argument is unspecified, then all variants in table will be selected. More details about the use of conditions could be found here?. An optional condition --samples [condition] can also be used to limit selected variants to specified samples.\nBasic usages of the command  Examples: Load a sample project Let us load a sample project simple from online:\n% vtools init select --parent vt_simple  The project has a master variant table with 1,611 variant,\n% vtools show tables table #variants date message variant 1,611  from two samples,\n% vtools show samples sample_name filename SAMP1 V1.vcf SAMP1 V2.vcf SAMP1 V3.vcf  \nVariant info fields provide annotation information for all variants in a project. They are usually imported from source data using command vtools import, and are listed as variant.NAME in the output of vtools show fields. You can use these fields to select variants from the master variant table, or another variant table.\n Examples: Select variants by variant info fields This project has the following fields\n% vtools show fields variant.chr variant.pos variant.ref variant.alt  This project does not have many interesting fields, but we can at least select variants by chromosome, position, reference or alternative allele.\n% select variant 'pos \u0026lt; 200000' -t pos_20k 'variants with position \u0026lt; 20000' Running: 0 0.0/s in 00:00:00 INFO: 81 variants selected.  This command write selected variants to a table pos_20k. A message is optional but is highly recommended because it helps you remember what variants this table contains. The message will be displayed in the output ofvtools show tablesandvtools show table TBL@@,\n% vtools show tables table #variants date message pos_20k 81 Jul13 variants with position \u0026lt; 20000 variant 1,611  You can use multiple conditions to select tables, as in\n% vtools select variant 'pos \u0026lt; 200000' 'ref=\u0026quot;T\u0026quot;' -t 'pos \u0026lt; 20k ref=T' \\ % 'Variants with position \u0026lt; 20000 and with reference allele T' Running: 0 0.0/s in 00:00:00 INFO: 20 variants selected.  The resulting table has a name with space and special characters \u0026lt; and =. Such names are allowed but should be properly quoted. If you need to specify OR condition, you can do\n% vtools select variant 'pos \u0026lt; 200000 OR ref=\u0026quot;T\u0026quot;' -t 'pos \u0026lt; 20k or ref=T' \\ % 'Variants with position \u0026lt; 20000 or with reference allele T' Running: 1 953.3/s in 00:00:00 INFO: 428 variants selected.  \n Name of variant tables can contain arbitrary characters so names such as 'TRA@' and 'AA=T' are acceptable. You should however properly quote such names to avoid accidental shell interpretation of these names (e.g. expansion of * and ?). Multiple conditions are allowed and are joined by 'AND'. You can use a single condition with OR to specify OR condition (e.g. DP \u0026gt; 10 OR pos\u0026lt;20000).  Variant info fields can also be added by command vtools update. The --from_stat option of this command is most useful because it can calculate genotype statistics (e.g. number of genotypes, number of homozygotes etc) for each variant across all or selected samples. Such information can then be used to select variants that are, for example, singletons in the database.\n Examples: Select variant by genotype statistics We can add a field num to present the number of genotypes in three samples\n% vtools update variant --from_stat 'num=#(GT)' Counting variants: 100% [====================================================] 3 300.0/s in 00:00:00 INFO: Adding variant info field num Updating variant: 100% [=================================================] 1,611 55.7K/s in 00:00:00 INFO: 1611 records are updated  The fields are now available to the project\n% vtools show fields variant.chr variant.pos variant.ref variant.alt variant.num  and can be used to select variants. For example, the following command select variants that appear in all three samples,\n% vtools select variant 'num=3' -t inAllSamples 'variants that are in all three samples' Running: 1 988.1/s in 00:00:00 INFO: 511 variants selected.  \nYou do not have to select from the master variant table, and in case that you only need to saved the selected variants, you can use option --count to output the number of selected variants, or use option --output to output variants. The latter option is equivalent to saving selected variants to a table and outputting variants in that table using command vtools output. Please refer to command vtools output for details.\n Examples: Count or output selected variants For example, the following command count the number of variants that appear in all samples from variants in table pos \u0026lt; 20k or ref=T.\n% vtools select 'pos \u0026lt; 20k or ref=T' 'num=3' -c Counting variants: 0 0.0/s in 00:00:00 125  You can also have a look at these variants without saving them to a table\n% vtools select 'pos \u0026lt; 20k or ref=T' 'num=3' --output chr pos ref alt num -l 10 1 5966 T G 3 1 10007 G A 3 1 20723 G C 3 1 20786 G T 3 1 31705 A G 3 1 44243 T C 3 1 44353 G A 3 1 44539 C T 3 1 47862 G T 3 1 52066 T C 3  \nSelect variants using annotation fields You can select variants from a variant table based on fields from external annotation databases. Although annotation databases have different types and are linked to the project in different ways (e.g. variant databases link to individual variants, and range databases annotate groups of variants), they appear the same from a user point of view.\nIn contrast to variant info fields that annotate all variants, annotation databases usually do not cover all variants in the project and variants that are not annotated have value NULL for these annotation fields. Because almost all annotation databases has a field chr, the most frequently used queries for these databases are probably the membership queies such as XXX.chr IS NOT NULL@, and @XXX.chr is NULL. The former identifies all variants that are in the database, and the latter identifies all variants that are not in the database.\n Examples: Select variants based on database membership Let us first link the project to the dbSNP database\n% vtools use dbSNP INFO: Downloading annotation database from annoDB/dbSNP.ann INFO: Downloading annotation database from http://vtools.houstonbioinformatics.org/annoDB/dbSNP-hg19_137.DB.gz INFO: Using annotation DB dbSNP in project select. INFO: dbSNP version 137  then find out all the variants that are in the dbSNP database:\n% vtools select variant 'dbSNP.chr IS NOT NULL' -t inDbSNP 'variants in dbSNP version 137' WARNING: Existing table inDbSNP is renamed to inDbSNP_Jul14_021354. Running: 3 417.4/s in 00:00:00 INFO: 9 variants selected.  We can see the rsname of these variants\n% vtools output inDbSNP chr pos ref alt dbSNP.name --all 1 88909 C T rs4951948 1 791858 G A rs141858431 1 809043 C T rs201498940 1 880922 C T rs187444884 1 558663 G A rs4951900 1 746775 A G rs2722507 1 746775 A G rs190225900 1 816001 G A rs111789261 1 990773 C T rs2799072 1 823504 T C rs78498238  Here we use the --all option of command vtools output because a variant can have multiple rsnames, and this is indeed the case for mutation A-\u0026gt;G at chr1:746775.\nThe syntax is the same for range-based databases. For example, if we use the refGene database,\n% vtools use refGene INFO: Downloading annotation database from annoDB/refGene.ann INFO: Downloading annotation database from http://vtools.houstonbioinformatics.org/annoDB/refGene-hg19_20110909.DB.gz INFO: Using annotation DB refGene in project select. INFO: refseq Genes  we can find out all the variants that are not in dbSNP but in one of the ref seq genes,\n% vtools select variant 'dbSNP.chr IS NULL' 'refGene.chr IS NOT NULL' -t inRefGene 'variants that are in refGene but not dbSNP' Running: 17 375.9/s in 00:00:00 INFO: 727 variants selected.  \nYou of course do not have to limit yourself to the membership conditions because annotation databases provides many fields that can be used to select variants. For example, the dbNSFP database provides SIFT and PolyPhen2 scores for non-synonymous variants in CCDS genes, you can select variants that are probably damaging based on such information.\n Examples: Select variants by values of annotation fields Let us first link the dbNSFP database,\n% vtools use dbNSFP INFO: Downloading annotation database from annoDB/dbNSFP.ann INFO: Downloading annotation database from http://vtools.houstonbioinformatics.org/annoDB/dbNSFP-hg18_hg19_2_0b4.DB.gz INFO: Using annotation DB dbNSFP in project select.

If you do not need such backup tables, you can remove them using command vtools remove tables,\n% vtools remove tables '*Jul*' INFO: Removing table damaging_Jul14_214229  here a wildcard pattern is used to remove all backup tables created in July.\n\nOne of the common use of annotation databases is to identify variants that belong to certain genes, exonic regions of genes, or pathways. Databases that are useful for these operations are refGene, refGene_exon, knownGene, knownGene_exon, and keggPathway.\n Examples: Select variants by gene, exon regions and pathway membership Let us first load the keggPathway database. Because this database is a field database that annotates ccdsGene ID, it should be linked to a database that contains CCDS ID:\n% vtools use ccdsGene INFO: Downloading annotation database from annoDB/ccdsGene.ann INFO: Downloading annotation database from http://vtools.houstonbioinformatics.org/annoDB/ccdsGene-hg19_20111206.DB.gz Binning ranges: 100% [=====================================] 25,504 65.1K/s in 00:00:00 INFO: Using annotation DB ccdsGene in project select.

As you can see from the above output, the KEGG pathway database contains 6881 CCDS genes, but also has 68 IDs that are not recognizable by the current version of the CCDS database.\nAnyway, the following command lists all CCDS genes and refGenes that contain one or more variants in the project,\n% vtools output variant ccdsGene.name refGene.name2 | sort | uniq . . .

If you need to find out all the variants that belong to a particular gene, you can use\n% vtools select variant 'refGene.name2 = \u0026quot;AGRN\u0026quot;' -t AGRN Running: 13 918.9/s in 00:00:00 INFO: 91 variants selected.  You can also output the pathway that this gene belong as follows:\n% vtools select variant 'refGene.name2 = \u0026quot;AGRN\u0026quot;' --output \\ chr pos ref alt refGene.name2 keggpathway.kgID keggPathway.kgDesc -l 10 --all 1 955702 A G AGRN hsa04512 ECM-receptor interaction 1 955802 A T AGRN hsa04512 ECM-receptor interaction 1 955812 A G AGRN hsa04512 ECM-receptor interaction 1 956056 A G AGRN hsa04512 ECM-receptor interaction 1 956132 A G AGRN hsa04512 ECM-receptor interaction 1 956443 A G AGRN hsa04512 ECM-receptor interaction 1 956486 C G AGRN hsa04512 ECM-receptor interaction 1 958089 C A AGRN hsa04512 ECM-receptor interaction 1 961230 T C AGRN hsa04512 ECM-receptor interaction 1 961997 C T AGRN hsa04512 ECM-receptor interaction  \nPlease read the description of fields from the output of vtools show fields carefully to avoid wrongful interpretation of annotation values. For example, SIFT_score provided by dbNSFP verion 1.0 are normalized (1-original score) so a higher score means higher probability of being damaging. It is no longer normalized in version 2.0 and latter so a smaller score (e.g. \u0026lt; 0.05) means more damaging.\nIf you select variants based on some condition, and then its NOT condition, you might be surprised to find that some variants belong to both sets. This is because some variants match multiple records in the annotation database, and are selected by these seemingly contradicting conditions. For example, a variant can belong to multipe isoforms of a gene might be benign in one gene and damaging in another. The variant will be selected by both benigh and damaging conditions.\nSelect variants according to sample genotypes It is sometimes useful to select variants based on sample genotypes, to answer questions such as what variants are available in the affected individuals. Command vtools select accepts a parameter --samples and will select variants that belong to selected samples. This parameter accepts one or more conditions by which samples are selected. For example --samples 1 selects all samples (condition True), --samples 'sample_name = \u0026quot;CEU\u0026quot;' selects a sample with name CEU, and --samples 'filename like \u0026quot;\u0026lt;span class='CEU'\u0026gt;\u0026quot;' selects all samples that are imported from files with filename containing CEU. \n Examples: Select variants that belong to some or all samples Our project contains three samples with the same name SAMP1, which is not unusual for pipelines that produce .vcf files with a default name.\n% vtools show samples sample_name filename SAMP1 V1.vcf SAMP1 V2.vcf SAMP1 V3.vcf  We can rename samples using command vtools admin --rename_samples but we can also identify samples by filename here. For example, the following command selects all variants imported from V1.vcf to a table V1.\n% vtools select variant --samples 'filename = \u0026quot;V1.vcf\u0026quot;' -t V1 'variants imported from V1.vcf' INFO: 1 samples are selected by condition: filename = \u0026quot;V1.vcf\u0026quot; Running: 2 791.8/s in 00:00:00 INFO: 989 variants selected.  \n Samples without genotype information can be imported from data without genotype by specifying sample names. Such \u0026lsquo;samples\u0026rsquo; can help you identify the source of variants. Variants do not have to belong to any sample so it is not surprising that vtools select TABLE --sample 1 do not have to select all variants in TABLE.  "

	"content": " Data-adaptive Sum Test for Protective and Deleterious Variants Introduction The data-adaptive sum test (aSum) by Han and Pan 2010[^Fang Han and Wei Pan (2010) A Data-Adaptive Sum Test for Disease Association with Multiple Common or Rare Variants. Human Heredity doi:10.1159/000288704. http://www.karger.com/doi/10.1159/000288704^] is the first method that took into consideration the difference in direction of effects (protective or deleterious) of rare variants in the same genetic region analyzed by a rare variant association test. It is a two-stage approach. In the first stage the effect size of each rare variant is evaluated in a multivariate regression analysis, identifying the variants having significant \u0026ldquo;protective\u0026rdquo; effects, i.e., variants with a negative log odds ratio associated with a {$p$} value smaller than {$0.1$}. In the second stage, variants are collapsed across the genetic region similar to Morris and Zeggini 2010[^Andrew P. Morris and Eleftheria Zeggini (2010) An evaluation of statistical approaches to rare variant analysis in genetic association studies. Genetic Epidemiology doi:10.1002/gepi.20450. http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/gepi.20450^] but with the coding for protective variants flipped. The test statistic is a score test for logistic regression for case control data.\nThe implementation of stage 1 in this program differs from the original paper. Instead of evaluating the effect size for each variant, it evaluates the difference in MAF of each variant between case and controls via an exact test to determine which variants are to be re-coded in stage 2. The same {$p\u0026lt;0.1$} criteria is used for stage 1, but in effect is more stringent than the original criteria for a multivariate logistic regression analysis.\nDetails Command interface vtools show test aSum Name: aSum Description: Adaptive Sum score test for protective and deleterious variants, Han \u0026amp; Pan 2010 usage: vtools associate --method aSum [-h] [--name NAME] [-q1 MAFUPPER] [-q2 MAFLOWER] [-p N] [--adaptive C] Adaptive Sum score test for protective and deleterious variants, Han \u0026amp; Pan 2010. In the first stage of the test, each variant site are evaluated for excess of minor alleles in controls and genotype codings are flipped, and the second stage performs a burden test similar to BRV (Morris \u0026amp; Zeggini 2009). This two-stage test is robust to a mixture of protective/risk variants within one gene, yet is computationally intensive. aSum test is a two-tailed test. optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit --name NAME Name of the test that will be appended to names of output fields, usually used to differentiate output of different tests, or the same test with different parameters. -q1 MAFUPPER, --mafupper MAFUPPER Minor allele frequency upper limit.

This option is useful for aggregation output where summary statistics are grouped by one or more fields. --order_by [FIELD [FIELD ...]] Order output by specified fields in ascending order. -u, --unique Remove duplicated records while keeping the order of output. This option can be time- and RAM-consuming because it keeps all outputted records in RAM to identify duplicated records. You should pipe output to command 'uniq' if you only need to remove adjacent duplicated lines.  Details This command differs from vtools select only in that it excludes (rather than selects) from a variant table a subset of variants satisfying given condition(s), count, output or save the remaining variants.\nHowever, command `vtools exclude is not simply a `vtools select command with a reversed condtion. As we will show in the examples, command \u0026ldquo;`vtools select table cond\u0026rdquo; (e.g. sift_score \u0026gt; 0.95) and \u0026ldquo;`vtools exclude table reverse-cond\u0026rdquo; (e.g. sift_score \u0026lt;= 0.95) might select different sets of variants. This happens when\n If field values for some variants are missing (NULL), they will not be selected by commands such as `vtools select table \u0026quot;sift_score \u0026gt; 0.95\u0026quot; and `vtools select table \u0026quot;sift_score \u0026lt;= 0.95\u0026quot;. Variants without a score and with score \u0026gt; 0.95 can be selected by command `vtools exclude table \u0026quot;sift_score \u0026lt;= 0.95\u0026quot;. Alternatively, you can use command `vtools select table \u0026quot;sift_score \u0026gt; 0.95 OR sift_score is NULL\u0026quot; to explicitly specify the NULL case.\n If there are multiple entries for a variant in the annotation database, these variants might match both conditions. This is, for example, the case for some variants in dbNSFP when these variants are included in different genes and have different damaging scores. These variants will only be selected by `vtools select.\n  Examples:\nFor example,\n% vtools select ns 'sift_score \u0026gt; 0.95' -t ns_damaging Running: 0 0.0/s in 00:00:00 INFO: 10 variants selected.  selects 10 variants. If we remove non-synonymous variants with sift_score \u0026lt;= 0.95, we will get 9 variants.\n% vtools exclude ns 'sift_score \u0026lt;= 0.95' -t ns_excl_benign Running: 0 0.0/s in 00:00:00 INFO: 9 variants selected.  We track this difference using vtools compare\n% vtools compare ns_damaging ns_excl_benign --difference diff -v0  and output the information for this variant\n% vtools output diff variant_id chr pos ref alt sift_score genename --build hg18 1036 5 139908704 C A 1 ANKHD1-EIF4EBP3 1036 5 139908704 C A 0.942108 EIF4EBP3  if we use the complete dbNSFP annotation database we can show more fields\n% vtools output diff variant_id chr pos ref alt CCDSid sift_score genename Descriptive_gene_name --build hg18 #id chr pos ref alt CCDSid sift_score genename Descriptive_gene_name 1036 5 139908704 C A CCDS4224.1 1.0 ANKHD1-EIF4EBP3 ANKHD1-EIF4EBP3 readthrough 1036 5 139908704 C A CCDS4226.1 0.942108 EIF4EBP3 eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 3  It turns out that this variant has two entries in dbNSFP for different genes. In this case the variant matches both conditions \u0026ldquo;sift_score\u0026gt;0.95\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;sift_score\u0026lt;=0.95\u0026rdquo;.

A table name will be automatically repeated for the comparison of genotype of multiple samples if only one table is specified. optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit --union [TABLE [DESC ...]] Print the number (default) or save variants with TYPE in the TYPE of any of the tables (T1 | T2 | T3 ...) to TABLE if a name is specified. An optional message can be added to describe the table. --intersection [TABLE [DESC ...]] Print the number (default) or save variants with TYPE in the TYPE of all the tables (T1 \u0026amp; T2 \u0026amp; T3 ...) to TABLE if a name is specified. An optional message can be added to describe the table. --difference [TABLE [DESC ...]] Print the number (default) or save variants with TYPE in the TYPE of the first, but not in the TYPE of others (T1 - T2 - T3...) to TABLE if a name is specified. An optional message can be added to describe the table. --expression EXPR [DESC ...] Evaluate a set expression with table names representing variants in these tables. Operators | (or), \u0026amp; (and), - (difference) and ^ (A or B but not both) are allowed. The results will be saved to table if the result is assigned to a name (e.g. --expression 'D=A-(B\u0026amp;C)'). The table names in the expression can be written as _1, _2 etc if tables are listed before the option, and be used to populate the list of tables if it was left unspecified. --mode {variant,site,genotype} Compare variants (chr, pos, ref, alt), site (chr, pos), or genotype (chr, pos, ref, alt, GT for a specified sample) of variants. The results are variants from all input tables that match specified condition. The default comparison TYPE compares variants in input variant tables. For the comparison of sites, the position of all variants are collected and compared, and variants (in all tables) with site in resulting set of sites are returned. For the comparison of genotypes, the genotypes of specified samples for all variants (see option --samples) are collected and compared, and variants with genotype in resulting set of genotypes are returned. The results of genotype comparisons are affected by runtime option treat_missing_as_wildtype because items with missing genotype (chr, pos, ref, alt, NULL) are excluded if treat_missing_as_wildtype is false (default), and are treated as (chr, pos, ref, alt, 0) otherwise. The default comparison type is variant, or genotype if option --samples is specified. --samples [SAMPLES [SAMPLES ...]] A list of sample names corresponding to the variant tables to compare. An error will be raised if a sample name matches no or multiple samples or if a sample does not have any genotype. -v {0,1,2}, --verbosity {0,1,2} Output error and warning (0), info (1) and debug (2) information to standard output (default to 1).  Details Command vtools compare compares variants in two or more variant tables. In the basic form, this command identifies variants that appear in one table but not others (set difference), in one or the tables (set union), or in all tables (set intersection). The results can be counted or written to a variant table.\nThe items being compare in this case are variants (namely chr, pos, ref, and alt), which can be reduced to sites (chr and pos), or expanded to genotypes of specified samples (chr, pos, ref, alt, and GT of an associated sample). The results are variants (from all involved tables) that belong to the resulting sites or genotypes.\nCompare variants in variant tables  Examples: Load a sample project and create a few variant tables\n% vtools init compare % vtools admin --load_snapshot vt_simple % vtools use refGene_exon-hg18_20110909 % vtools use dbSNP-hg18_130 % vtools select variant 'dbSNP.chr IS NOT NULL' -t inDbSNP 'In dbSNP database' % vtools select variant 'refGene_exon.chr IS NOT NULL' -t exonic 'In exonic regions of ref seq genes' % vtools select variant 'refGene_exon.name2 == \u0026quot;AGRN\u0026quot;' -t G_AGRN 'In gene AGRM' % vtools select variant 'refGene_exon.name2 == \u0026quot;FAM41C\u0026quot;' -t G_FAM41C 'In gene FAM41C'  \nIn the default \u0026lsquo;variant\u0026rsquo; comparison type, command vtools compare compares variants in two or more tables and look for variants that in one, all, or none of the tables. It either counts and prints the number of matching variants or write the variants to a variant table. For example, if the master variant table has 4 variants, and when we compare variant tables T1 and T2,\n| variant | tables | || | chr | pos | ref | alt | T1 | T2 | | 1 | 31705 | A | G | ✓ | ✓ | | 1 | 50195 | T | C | ✓ | | | 1 | 50195 | T | G | | ✓ | | 1 | 50589 | C | A | | ✓ |\nThe number of variants for each type of comparison would be\n% vtools compare T1 T2 INFO: Reading approximately 2 variants in T1...

Option --intersection and --union will select variants that belong to all or any of all tables, respectively. Option --difference will select variants that are in the first, but not in any of the rest of the tables (A - B - C - D ...).\n Examples: Comparing more than two tables\n% vtools compare exonic 'G_*' --difference other 'Exonic variants not in AGRN and FAM41C' INFO: Reading 151 variants in exonic...

Writing to other: 100% [========================================] 76 5.2K/s in 00:00:00  \nThis command allows the use of wildcard characters * and ? in the specification of table names, which can be handy if you have a large number of variant tables for, e.g. variants in a list of genes.\nNow, if you have more complex expressions that involve more than one types of set operations, you can use option --expression for it. For example\n% vtools compare --expression 'A-(B|C)'  print out the number of variants in table A, but not in B or C. The allowed operations are\n A | B: In table A or B (--union) A \u0026amp; B: In table A and B (--intersection) A - B: In table A but not in B (--difference) A ^ B: In table A or B but not in both ((A|B)-(A\u0026amp;B)).  If you need to save the result to a table, you can assign the expression to a table name,\n% vtools compare --expression 'D=A-(B|C)' 'variants in A but not in B or C'  If you have a table with non-alpha-numeric characters, you should quote it inside the expression using either single or double quotes, for example,\n% vtools compare --expression 'D=\u0026quot;@TP32\u0026quot;-( B | C)'  Note that these commands are simplified version of\n% vtools compare \u0026quot;@TP32\u0026quot; B C --expression 'D=\u0026quot;@TP32\u0026quot;-( B | C)'  and if you do list the tables before the option, you could use _1, _2 etc in place of table names,\n% vtools compare \u0026quot;@TP32\u0026quot; B C --expression 'D=_1 - ( _2 | _3)' --union all_variants  This syntax is recommended if you would like to perform multiple operations for the same set of tables (e.g. --expression and --union in the above example), or if you would like to compare variants by genotypes, in which case a sample should be specified for each table.\n Examples: Use set expression to compare multiple tables\nIf we would like to exclude variants that are not in DBSNP, but keep those in exonic regions, we can run\n% vtools compare --expression 'variant - inDBSNP | exonic' INFO: Comparing tables variant, inDBSNP, exonic INFO: Reading 1,611 variants in variant...

Although we usually compare all genotypes of samples using a command similar to (e.g. genotypes in SAMP1 and SAMP2 with variants in table variant)\n% vtools compare variant --samples SAMP1 SAMP2  you can compare a subset of genotypes using command\n% vtools compare exonic --samples SAMP1 SAMP2  or even different variants from each sample, as in\n% vtools compare var1 var2 --samples SAMP1 SAMP2  In these cases, genotypes that belong to specified variant table are selected and compared, and variants that belong to the resulting set of genotypes are returned.\nFor example, suppose the master variant table variant has the following 4 variants, and two samples both have 2 genotypes,\n| variant | genotypes | || | chr | pos | ref | alt | GT of SAMP1 | GT of SAMP2 | | 1 | 31705 | A | G | 2 | . | | 1 | 50195 | T | C | . | . | | 1 | 50195 | T | G | 1 | 1 | | 1 | 50589 | C | A | . | 1 |\nThe first command would yield results\n% vtools compare variant --samples SAMP1 SAMP2 INFO: Reading genotype of sample SAMP1 of approximately 4 variants in variant...

If we run\n% vtools admin --set_runtime_option treat_missing_as_wildtype=1 INFO: Option treat_missing_as_wildtype is set to True  The output of command changes to\n% vtools compare variant --samples SAMP1 SAMP2 INFO: Reading genotype of sample SAMP1 of approximately 4 variants in variant...

As we can see, about half of genotypes of each sample are shared with other samples.\n\nIdentify genotypes that are unique to one sample There are two cases to consider here. The first one is that the mutation might exist in another sample, but with different genotype. This can be achieved using a straigforward genotype comparison:\n Examples: Identify genotypes are unique in one sample\n% vtools compare variant --difference S1 --samples SAMP1 SAMP2 SAMP3 INFO: Reading genotypes of sample SAMP1 of approximately 1,611 geno in variant...

It is interesting to note that the site-intersection of two variant tables with 2 and 3 variants respectively produces a variant table of 3 variants.\nExample: identification of de novo mutations In a parent - offspring setting, we are often interested in locating variants of offspring that are not inherited from his or her parents (de novo mutations). Assuming that we have a project with three samples with names offspring, father and mother, we can first get variants from offspring and parents using commands such as\n% vtools select variant --samples \u0026quot;sample_name='offspring'\u0026quot; -t WGS3_1 % vtools select variant --samples \u0026quot;sample_name='father'\u0026quot; -t WGS3_2 % vtools select variant --samples \u0026quot;sample_name='mother'\u0026quot; -t WGS3_3  We can compare these three tables by genotype, variant, and site, each have different meanings.\nThe easiest one is to compare variants.

For example, both parents have mutants T-G at chr1:822005 and the offspring have mutation T-\u0026gt;A, and parents and offspring have different insertions at some other locations.\nIn summary, when we identify offspring-only variants, the command\n% vtools compare WGS3_1 WGS3_2 WGS3_3 --difference by_variant  identifies all variants (113,553 in this example) that are available only in offspring. These include the true de novo mutations (or genotype calling errors, 95,653 in this example) idenfified by\n% vtools compare WGS3_1 WGS3_2 WGS3_3 --difference by_site --mode site  and these with different variants but at the same sites (see the output of the last command).

Examples: Specify a header to the output The easiest way to add a header is to use parameter --header and let variant tools generate a default header from field names:\n% vtools output variant chr pos ref alt aa ac --header -l 10 chr pos ref alt aa ac 1 1105366 T C T 4 1 1105411 G A G 1 1 1108138 C T c 7 1 1110240 T A T 1 1 1110294 G A A 29 1 3537996 T C C 156 1 3538692 G C G 13 1 3541597 C T C 1 1 3541652 G A G 27 1 3545211 G A G 1  If you are unhappy about the default header, you can specify one manually\n% vtools output variant chr pos ref alt aa ac --header chr pos ref alt 'ancestral allele' 'ancestral count' -l 10 -d, chr,pos,ref,alt,ancestral allele,ancestral count 1,1105366,T,C,T,4 1,1105411,G,A,G,1 1,1108138,C,T,c,7 1,1110240,T,A,T,1 1,1110294,G,A,A,29 1,3537996,T,C,C,156 1,3538692,G,C,G,13 1,3541597,C,T,C,1 1,3541652,G,A,G,27 1,3545211,G,A,G,1  If you have a longer header, or a header that is saved in a file, you can send the header to vtools output through its standard input\n% echo chr pos ref alt 'ancestral allele' 'ancestral count' | \\ vtools output variant chr pos ref alt aa ac --header - -l 10 chr pos ref alt ancestral allele ancestral count 1 1105366 T C T 4 1 1105411 G A G 1 1 1108138 C T c 7 1 1110240 T A T 1 1 1110294 G A A 29 1 3537996 T C C 156 1 3538692 G C G 13 1 3541597 C T C 1 1 3541652 G A G 27 1 3545211 G A G 1  \nYou can sort the output by one or more fields using option --order_by. variant tools by default oder fields in ascending order. You can order by descending order by adding DESC to field name.\n Examples: Order output by one or more field names You can oder the output using option --order_by, for example\n% vtools output variant chr pos ref alt aa ac --order_by ac aa -l 10 6 30018679 G T . 0 9 204719 C T C 0 1 17822092 C T C 0 5 140870754 G A G 0 6 7176795 G A G 0 7 156448542 G A G 0 19 2199303 G A G 0 2 237954632 G A G 0 6 158452418 G A G 0 8 134198127 A G G 0  You can order in descending oder by specifying DESC after field name, for example\n% vtools output variant chr pos ref alt aa ac --order_by 'ac DESC' 'aa' -l 10 4 95758290 G A A 210 10 117065165 G A A 210 12 27362133 G A A 210 10 46507614 T C C 210 1 195656991 A G G 210 1 203542044 A G G 210 1 204840282 A G G 210 10 97182314 A G G 210 1 157676358 G T T 210 12 62759070 A T T 210  \nIf your project has a primary and a secondary reference genomes, you can output variants in both coordinates.\n Examples: Output variants in alternative coordinates Our sample project uses the hg18 reference genome. We can add an alternative reference genome by mapping all variants from hg18 to hg19 coordinates:\n% vtools liftover hg19 INFO: Downloading liftOver tool from UCSC INFO: Downloading liftOver chain file from UCSC INFO: Exporting variants in BED format Exporting variants: 100% [==================================] 4,858 131.7K/s in 00:00:00 INFO: Running UCSC liftOver tool Updating table variant: 100% [===============================] 4,858 33.5K/s in 00:00:00  You can output variants in the primary reference genome,\n% vtools output variant chr pos ref alt aa ac --header --build hg18 -l 10 chr pos ref alt aa ac 1 1105366 T C T 4 1 1105411 G A G 1 1 1108138 C T c 7 1 1110240 T A T 1 1 1110294 G A A 29 1 3537996 T C C 156 1 3538692 G C G 13 1 3541597 C T C 1 1 3541652 G A G 27 1 3545211 G A G 1  or the alternative reference genome using option --build\n% vtools output variant chr pos ref alt aa ac --header --build hg19 -l 10 chr pos ref alt aa ac 1 1115503 T C T 4 1 1115548 G A G 1 1 1118275 C T c 7 1 1120377 T A T 1 1 1120431 G A A 29 1 3548136 T C C 156 1 3548832 G C G 13 1 3551737 C T C 1 1 3551792 G A G 27 1 3555351 G A G 1  \nOutput fields from annotation databases (option --all) You can output fields from one or more annotation databases in the same way as variant info fields. To output annotation fields of variants, you simply need to\n Link annotation databases to the project using command vtools use Use command vtools show annotation ANNODB or vtools show fields to check name and meaning of available fields Output annotation fields along with variant info fields. Name of annotation database can be ignored if there is no ambiguity.   Examples: Output fields of annotation fields Let us use annotation databases refGene and dbSNP,\n% vtools use refGene INFO: Downloading annotation database from annoDB/refGene.ann INFO: Downloading annotation database from http://vtools.houstonbioinformatics.org/annoDB/refGene-hg19_20110909.DB.gz INFO: Using annotation DB refGene in project output.

INFO: dbSNP version 137  because this project uses both hg18 and hg19, it can make use of the latest version of refGene and dbSNP databases that use hg19.\nThese two databases bring in a large number of annotation fields, as listed by command\n% vtools show fields variant.chr variant.pos variant.ref variant.alt variant.AA variant.AC variant.AN variant.DP variant.alt_chr variant.alt_pos refGene.name Gene name refGene.chr refGene.strand which DNA strand contains the observed alleles refGene.txStart Transcription start position refGene.txEnd Transcription end position refGene.cdsStart Coding region start refGene.cdsEnd Coding region end refGene.exonCount Number of exons refGene.score Score refGene.name2 Alternative name refGene.cdsStartStat cds start stat, can be 'non', 'unk', 'incompl', and 'cmp1' refGene.cdsEndStat cds end stat, can be 'non', 'unk', 'incompl', and 'cmp1' dbSNP.chr dbSNP.start start position in chrom (1-based) dbSNP.end end position in chrom (1-based). start=end means zero-length feature dbSNP.name dbSNP reference SNP identifier dbSNP.strand which DNA strand contains the observed alleles dbSNP.refNCBI Reference genomic sequence from dbSNP dbSNP.refUCSC Reference genomic sequence from UCSC lookup of chrom,chromStart,chromEnd dbSNP.observed Strand-specific observed alleles dbSNP.alt alternate allele on the '+' strand dbSNP.molType sample type, can be one of unknown, genomic or cDNA dbSNP.class Class of variant (single, in-del, het, named, mixed, insertion, deletion etc dbSNP.valid validation status, can be unknown, by-cluster, by- frequency, by-submitter, by-2hit-2allele, by-hapmap, and by-1000genomes dbSNP.avHet Average heterozygosity from all observations dbSNP.avHetSE Standard error for the average heterozygosity dbSNP.func Functional cetegory of the SNP (coding-synon, coding-nonsynon, intron, etc.) dbSNP.locType Type of mapping inferred from size on reference. dbSNP.submitterCount Number of distinct submitter handles for submitted SNPs for this ref SNP dbSNP.submitters List of submitter handles  You can output annotation fields as follows:\n% vtools output 'aa=T' chr pos ref alt dbSNP.name refGene.name refGene.name2 -l 10 1 1105366 T C rs111751804 NM_001130045 TTLL10 1 1110240 T A rs116321663 NM_001130045 TTLL10 1 6447088 T C rs11800462 NM_003790 TNFRSF25 1 6447275 T C rs3170675 NM_003790 TNFRSF25 1 11633148 T G rs9614 NM_012168 FBXO2 1 20897488 C T rs522496 NM_001122819 KIF17 1 20903629 T C rs2296225 NM_001122819 KIF17 1 35998535 T C rs7537203 NM_022111 CLSPN 1 36002845 T G rs115614983 NM_022111 CLSPN 1 40510176 T C rs2076697 NM_005857 ZMPSTE24  \nThis looks simple but the problem is more complicated than what is shown here, because a variant can match multiple records in annotation databases. For example, mutation T-\u0026gt;C at position 1105366 on chr1 belongs to reference sequences NM_153254 and NM_001130045 of the reference sequence database. Because vtools output by default only displays a random record of multiple records, its output can miss important information. To address this problem, an option --all is provided to output all annotation records. This option has its own problem though. For example, if you do not output the differentiating field that lead to multiple records, you can see a bunch of duplicated records.\n Examples: Use option \u0026ndash;all to list all annotation records Using option --all, command vtools output can display multiple records for a variant:\n% vtools output 'aa=T' chr pos ref alt dbSNP.name refGene.name refGene.name2 --all -l 10 1 1105366 T C rs111751804 NM_153254 TTLL10 1 1105366 T C rs111751804 NM_001130045 TTLL10 1 1110240 T A rs116321663 NM_153254 TTLL10 1 1110240 T A rs116321663 NM_001130045 TTLL10 1 6447088 T C rs11800462 NM_001039664 TNFRSF25 1 6447088 T C rs11800462 NM_148970 TNFRSF25 1 6447088 T C rs11800462 NM_148967 TNFRSF25 1 6447088 T C rs11800462 NM_148966 TNFRSF25 1 6447088 T C rs11800462 NM_148965 TNFRSF25 1 6447088 T C rs11800462 NM_003790 TNFRSF25  A consequence of this is that duplicated records can be displayed if the field that lead to multiple records is not outputted:\n% vtools output 'aa=T' chr pos ref alt dbSNP.name refGene.name2 --all -l 10 1 1105366 T C rs111751804 TTLL10 1 1105366 T C rs111751804 TTLL10 1 1110240 T A rs116321663 TTLL10 1 1110240 T A rs116321663 TTLL10 1 6447088 T C rs11800462 TNFRSF25 1 6447088 T C rs11800462 TNFRSF25 1 6447088 T C rs11800462 TNFRSF25 1 6447088 T C rs11800462 TNFRSF25 1 6447088 T C rs11800462 TNFRSF25 1 6447088 T C rs11800462 TNFRSF25  This is why the output of command vtools output --all is usually piped to command uniq,\n% vtools output 'aa=T' chr pos ref alt dbSNP.name refGene.name2 --all -l 10 | uniq 1 1105366 T C rs111751804 TTLL10 1 1110240 T A rs116321663 TTLL10 1 6447088 T C rs11800462 TNFRSF25  although uniq cannot suppress all duplicated records in all cases because it only removes adjacent duplicated records.\n\nOutput expressions of fields In addition to values of variant info and annotation fields, command vtools output can be used to output SQL-acceptable expressions that involves multiple fields. For example,\n Because variant tools uses 1-based coordinates, you might want to output pos-1 instead of pos to generate output with 0-based indexes, You can output allele frequency by dividing number of alternative alleles by total number of alleles,  In addition to basic arithmetic operations, variant tools accept additional mathematical and string extension functions for SQL queries using the loadable extensions mechanism from HERE, including mathematical functions acos, asin, atan, atn2, atan2, acosh, asinh, atanh, difference, degrees, radians, cos, sin, tan, cot, cosh, sinh, tanh, coth, exp, log, log10, power, sign, sqrt, square, ceil, floor, pi, and string operations replicate, charindex, leftstr, rightstr, ltrim, rtrim, trim, replace, reverse, proper, padl, padr, padc, strfilter.\n Examples: Output expressionf of fields This example demonstrates the use of SQL expressions in command vtools output. Note that the sqlite string concatenation operator is ||.\n% vtools output \u0026quot;aa=T\u0026quot; chr 'pos-1' 'refGene.name2 || \u0026quot;.\u0026quot; || refGene.name' 'log(DP)' --header -l 10 chr pos_1 refGene_name2___________refGene_name log_DP_ 1 1105365 TTLL10.NM_001130045 8.0867179203 1 1110239 TTLL10.NM_001130045 8.89219909204 1 6447087 TNFRSF25.NM_001039664 8.45340105833 1 6447274 TNFRSF25.NM_001039664 8.83506493503 1 11633147 FBXO2.NM_012168 7.01929665372 1 20897487 KIF17.NM_001122819 8.20576472523 1 20903628 KIF17.NM_001122819 8.8420265295 1 35998534 CLSPN.NM_022111 8.73841489717 1 36002844 CLSPN.NM_022111 8.79315687091 1 40510175 ZMPSTE24.NM_005857 8.71061952794  As you can see, the default header that variant tools generates replaces all non-alphanumeric characters by underscores, and you should most likely specify your own headers in these cases.\n\nOutput summary statistics of fields using SQL aggregating functions (option --group_by) In addition to functions that operate on values of the same field, you can use SQL aggregating functions to output summary statistics of fields. For example, you can use function count(*) to count the number of records, sum(DP) to get the sum of depth for all variants. More usefully, these operations can be applied to groups of variants defined by option --group_by.\nCommand vtools output accepts the following aggregating functions:\n All sqlite3 functions listed HERE are supported. The most useful ones are count, sum, avg, min and max. Additional aggregation functions such as stdev, variance, mode, median, lower_quartile, upper_quartile defined HERE.   Examples: Output summary statistics of fields The following command calculate the average depth for all variants:\n% vtools output variant 'avg(DP)' 6264.00102923  You can also output average of depth, grouped by variants that belong to genes,\n% vtools output variant refGene.name2 'count(*)' 'avg(DP)' --group_by refGene.name2 -l 10 . 20 5928.05 AARD 1 3919.0 AASDHPPT 2 7834.0 AATF 4 8590.0 ABCB9 3 3469.66666667 ABCC6 18 4963.27777778 ABLIM3 6 8895.5 ABTB2 3 6922.0 ACHE 4 5159.25 ACIN1 15 8962.73333333  Here count(*) is used to count the number of variants in each gene, and NA is a special group for variants that do not belong to any gene, which can be confirmed by command\n% vtools select variant 'refGene.chr is NULL' --output 'avg(DP)' 5928.05  Option --all should not be used in these commands because this option will lead to multiple entries for some variants, and biase the results. For example, the output of the following command differs from the previous one:\n% vtools output variant refGene.name2 'count(*)' 'avg(DP)' --group_by refGene.name2 --all -l 10 . 20 5928.05 AARD 1 3919.0 AASDHPPT 2 7834.0 AATF 4 8590.0 ABCB9 15 3469.66666667 ABCC6 18 4963.27777778 ABLIM3 6 8895.5 ABTB2 3 6922.0 ACHE 8 5159.25 ACIN1 47 8719.21276596  \nUsing option --all along with aggregating function will most likely lead to erroneous results because the aggregating function will be applied to a dataset with duplicated entries, unless you intentionally would like to count, for example, number of duplicated entries for each variant.\n"

	"content": " Export variants and samples to external files Usage % vtools export -h usage: vtools export [-h] [-o [OUTPUT]] [-s [COND [COND ...]]] [--format FORMAT] [--build BUILD] [--header [HEADER [HEADER ...]]] [-j JOBS] [-v {0,1,2}] table Export variants and genotypes in text, vcf and other formats. positional arguments: table A variant table whose variants will be exported. If parameter --samples is specified, only variants belong to one or more of the samples will be exported. optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit -o [OUTPUT], --output [OUTPUT] Name of output file. Output will be written to the standard output if this parameter is left unspecified. -s [COND [COND ...]], --samples [COND [COND ...]] Samples that will be exported, specified by conditions such as 'aff=1' and 'filename like \u0026quot;MG%\u0026quot;'. Multiple samples could be exported to a file if the output format allows. No sample will be outputted if this parameter is ignored. --format FORMAT Format of the exported file. It can be one of the variant tools supported file types such as VCF (cf. 'vtools show formats') or a local format specification file (with extension .fmt). Some formats accept additional parameters (cf. 'vtools show format FMT') and allows you to export additional or alternative fields. --build BUILD Build version of the reference genome (e.g. hg18) of the exported data. It can only be one of the primary (default) of alternative (if exists) reference genome of the project. --header [HEADER [HEADER ...]] A complete header or a list of names that will be joined by a delimiter specified by the file format to form a header. If a special name - is specified, the header will be read from the standard input, which is the preferred way to specify large multi-line headers (e.g. cat myheader | vtools export --header -). Strings in the form of %(VAR)s will be interpolated to values of variable VAR, which can be \u0026quot;sample_names\u0026quot; for list of sample names, \u0026quot;datetime\u0026quot; for current date and time, and \u0026quot;command\u0026quot; for the command used to create output. -j JOBS, --jobs JOBS Number of processes to export data. Multiple threads will be automatically used if there are a large number of samples. -v {0,1,2}, --verbosity {0,1,2} Output error and warning (0), info (1) and debug (2) information to standard output (default to 1).  Details vtools export and vtools output perform similar functions but with different emphasis. vtools output output variants and variant info fields (and their summary statistics) in a tabular format, but it does not output genotype or genotype info fields. In comparison, vtools export exports variant, variant info fields, genotype and genotype info in pre-specified formats.\nSupported file formats Command vtools show formats lists all formats that are supported by variant tools but some file formats can only be used to import or update variants. To check whether or not you can export data in a particular format, you can run command vtools show format FMT and check if it defines one or more Columns.\n Check details of file formats\n% vtools show format ANNOVAR Format: ANNOVAR Description: Input format of ANNOVAR. No genotype is defined. Columns: 1 chromosome 2 position (1-based) 3 end position 4 reference allele 5 alternative allele 6 optional column variant: chr Chromosome pos 1-based position ref Reference allele, '-' for insertion. alt Alternative allele, '-' for deletion. Format parameters: comment_string Output one or more fields to the optional comment column of this format. (default: )  Note the Columns section in the above configuration file. Columns in this section will be the output columns as a result of output. vtools export does not (yet) support as many formats as vtools import does, for example\n% vtools show format pileup_indel Format: pileup_indel Description: Input format for samtools pileup indel caller. This format imports chr, pos, ref, alt and genotype. Columns: None defined, cannot export to this format variant: chr Chromosome name pos Start position of the indel event. ref reference allele, '-' for insertion alt alternative allele, '-' for deletion Genotype: GT type of indel (homozygote or heterozygote) Other fields (usable through parameters): type String summarizing the indel type, one of Dn (deletion of length n) and In (insertion of length n) Format parameters: geno (default: GT)  You see that the Columns section is not defined. \nExport variants and variant info fields The motivation of this export format is to prepare input files for annotating variants using ANNOVAR\n Examples: Export in ANNOVAR format\n% vtools init test % vtools admin --load_snapshot vt_testData % vtools import CEU.vcf.gz --build hg18 --var_info DP % vtools export variant -o ANNOVAR.input --format ANNOVAR % head ANNOVAR.input 1 533 533 G C 1 41342 41342 T A 1 41791 41791 G A 1 44449 44449 T C 1 44539 44539 C T 1 44571 44571 G C 1 45162 45162 C T 1 52066 52066 T C ...

All these information needs to be specified through command line options of the vcf format. To learn what options are available, you can use command\n% vtools show format vcf  Section Other fields lists the fields that can be imported (if they exist in the input file), and section Format parameters lists the parameters that can be specified from command line.\nExport variants in VCF format The basic command to export variants in vcf format is vtools export TABLE --format vcf. In this case, the variants are exported in vcf format, without header and with default (missing) name, INFO, and FILTER fields. --format vcf can be ignored if a .vcf file is specified in option --output.\n Examples: export variants in vcf format Let us first get some data,\n% vtools init test % vtools admin --load_snapshot vt_testData % vtools import CEU.vcf.gz --build hg18 INFO: Importing variants from CEU.vcf.gz (1/1) CEU.vcf.gz: 100% [==============================================] 300 16.5K/s in 00:00:00 INFO: 288 new variants (288 SNVs) from 300 lines are imported.

PASS . 1 75891 . T C . PASS .  \nIndel variants are outputted in VCF format. That is to say, instead of using - to represent missing alleles, indels such as - =\u0026gt; A are outputted with padding alleles (e.g. G =\u0026gt; GA if the reference allele before the variant is G). The positions of the variants are automatically adjusted.\n Examples: export indel variants in vcf format\n% vtools init test -f % vtools admin --load_snapshot vt_testData % vtools import indels.vcf --build hg19 INFO: Importing variants from indels.vcf (1/1) indels.vcf: 100% [==============================================] 184 21.5K/s in 00:00:00 INFO: 137 new variants (1 SNVs, 77 insertions, 58 deletions, 7 complex variants) from 184 lines are imported.

Outputting values of a field is usually not recommended unless the values already conform to vcf standard.\nYou can specify fields that are not defined in vcf.fmt. However, because variant tools does not know how to output it (as value or flag etc), it will output its value directly without a field name. Such fields do not conform to the vcf format standard. To output fields that are not defined in vcf.fmt, it is recommended that you add the field to a local copy of vcf.fmt and use the modified format file to export data.\n Examples: export variant info fields\n% vtools export variant --var_info AA -o my.vcf % head my.vcf 1 533 .

More specifically,\n variant tools removes duplicate variants from input file when it imports data. If your data has multiple lines for a variant (e.g. the same variant with multiple rsnames), you will only be able to export one of them. variant tools split variants from an input file if there are multiple alternative alleles. It exports variants one by one so such variants will not be combined into records that define multiple variants. Variant tools does not import phase information of genotypes and it always output variants in the format of A/B.  Specify a header The --header option can be used to add a header to outputs. Although it is possible to specify a minimal header using option --header CHROM POS ID REF ALT QUAL FILTER INFO FORMAT, it is useful to create a header file and send it to vtools export command through standard input (option --header -). The latter is preferred because vcf files usually has long headers.\n Examples: export in vcf format with header\n% vtools export variant --header CHROM POS ID REF ALT QUAL FILTER INFO FORMAT -o my_indel.vcf % head -5 my_indel.vcf CHROM POS ID REF ALT QUAL FILTER INFO FORMAT 1 10433 . A AC . PASS . 1 10439 . AC A . PASS . 1 54788 . CC C . PASS . 1 54789 . C CT . PASS .  You can add '%(sample_names)s' to the header to add a list of sample names to the header if you are exporting sample genotypes (see examples below).\nAlternatively you can create a text file with a tab delimited and use --header -. For example, we can use the header of an existing vcf file, and export variants with command\n% head -200 indels.vcf | grep '#' | vtools export variant --format ~/vtools/format/vcf --header - \u0026gt; my_indels.vcf INFO: Reading header from standard input Writing: 100% [=====================================================================] 137 13.8K/s in 00:00:00 INFO: 129 lines are exported from variant table variant  \nOutput genotype Genotypes of selected samples can be outputted if you use use parameter --samples to specify samples to output. --samples 1 will output genotypes of all samples.\n Examples: export genotypes of selected samples\n% vtools init test -f % vtools admin --load_snapshot vt_testData % vtools import CEU.vcf.gz --geno_info DP_geno --var_info AA --build hg18 % vtools export variant --samples 'sample_name like \u0026quot;NA128%\u0026quot;' -o my.vcf INFO: Genotypes of 8 samples are exported.

The graphics are powered by the R package ggplot2. Fonts, color, page layout etc can be specified from the command interface, generating high quality and customized graphs.\nInput data format vtools associate command typically generates two types of output: output of gene based association tests and single variant analysis.\nGene-based test input #refGene_name2 sample_size_SBurdenTest statistic_SBurdenTest pvalue_SBurdenTest AAGAB 1246 14 0.709392 ABHD2 1246 1 0.423756 ACAN 1246 107 0.0235792 ACSBG1 1246 23 0.887873 ACTC1 1246 0 1 ADAL 1246 2 1 ADAMTS17 1246 19 0.875558 ADAM10 1246 0 0.0766778 AGBL1 1246 120 0.119562 ...

A reference genome will be automatically downloaded if it does not exist in the local resource directory. Validate reported sex: --validate_sex Validate the sex of samples by checking the genotypes of samples on sex chromosomes (excluding pseudo- autosomal regions). Sex of samples are determined by a phenotype named sex or gender with values 1/2, M/F or Male/Female. Inconsistency will be reported if, for example, a female sample has genotypes on chromosome Y. Save and load snapshots: --save_snapshot NAME MESSAGE Create a snapshot of the current project with NAME, which could be re-loaded using command 'vtools admin --load_snapshot'. A filename with extension .tar, .tgz or .tar.gz can be used to save the snapshot to a specific directory with compression but such snapshots are not listed by command 'vtools show snapshots'. --extra_files [FILE [FILE ...]] Additional files that will be saved along with the project and genotype databases. This could include customized format files, project-specific annotations, and results. Files outside of the current project directory are not allowed due to security considerations. --load_snapshot NAME Revert the current project to specified snapshot. All changes since the that snapshot will be lost. The NAME should be one of the project snapshots or online snapshots listed by command 'vtools show snapshots', or name of a local snapshot file (with extension .tar, .tgz or .tar.gz). Set values for some various internal options.: --set_runtime_option OPTION [OPTION ...] Set value to internal options such as the batch size for database options. The default values of these options were chosen to fit most usage patterns but tweaking them might provide better performance under certain circumstances. Please use command \u0026quot;vtools show runtime_options\u0026quot; to list all currently supported runtime options. --reset_runtime_option OPT Reset value to a runtime option to its default value. Misc utilities: --fasta2crr FASTA [FASTA ...] Convert fasta files to a crr file (a binary format for faster access) that can be used by variant tools. This is only needed if you are working with a reference genome that is not supported by variant tools. This parameter accepts a list of fastq files (URLs and .gz format are acceptable) followed by the name of the .crr file. The .crr file should be put under the project directory or the local resource directory (under directory reference) to be usable by variant tools.  Details The vtools admin command performs various adminstrative functions for a variant tools project.\nDownload or update local resources (--update_resource) Resources, such as annotation databases, format specification, and reference genomes are downloaded automatically when they are used. However, if you prefer having all resources downloaded before using variant tools (so that you do not have to wait each time when a source is needed), you can use option --update_resource to download them in batch. The resources will be saved to your home directory under ~/.variant_tools unless you change this location using runtime option @local_resource.\nThis command by default download all current resources (e.g. most recent versions of annotation databases for latest version of reference genome). You can however using option hg18 to download resources for another reference genome, or option existing to update only resources that exists locally.\n Examples: Download resources The following command checks files under the local resource directory, ignored 112 existing files and downloaded a new version of EVS annotation database.\n% vtools init temp # needed if there is no project in the current directory % vtools admin --update_resource Scanning 112 local files: 100% [========================] 18,537,133,615 407.1M/s in 00:00:45 INFO: 2 files need to be downloaded or updated 1/2 annoDB/evs-6500.DB.gz: 100% [==========================] 109,502,699.0 1.4M/s in 00:01:17 2/2 annoDB/evs-6500.ann: 100% [=================================] 7,984.0 40.2K/s in 00:00:00  \nRename samples (--rename_samples) Although samples in variant tools can be identified by items other than sample names (e.g. filename such as filename = \u0026quot;V1.vcf\u0026quot;), or any of the phenotypes such as aff=1), sample name is the important identifier for samples and are used ubiquitously for reports. Sample names are assigned during vtools import, using either names specified in input files, or names specified by parameter --sample_names. If a sample name is missing or mis-specified, you can use the vtools admin --rename_samples to rename samples.\nGiven a condition (COND) that selects one or more samples, this command accepts two types of inputs:\n% vtools admin --rename_samples COND name  and\n% vtools admin --rename_samples COND name1 name2  In the first option, all selected samples are renamed to name. In the second option, the first instance of name1 in sample names will be replaced by name2. The former is similar to linux command move src dest and the latter is similar to command rename pat1 pat2 files.\n Examples: Rename samples Let us first get some data and a few samples\nvtools init admin -f vtools admin --load_snapshot vt_testData vtools import V*.vcf --build hg19 vtools import CASAVA18_SNP.txt --format CASAVA18_snps  There are four samples\n% vtools show samples sample_name filename SAMP1 V1.vcf SAMP1 V2.vcf SAMP1 V3.vcf max_gt CASAVA18_SNP.txt  The first three samples share the same name, which can lead to erroneous results during analysis (e.g. vtools associate will treat them as genotypes from the same sample). We can rename them using commands\n% vtools admin --rename_samples 'filename=\u0026quot;V1.vcf\u0026quot;' V1 % vtools admin --rename_samples 'filename=\u0026quot;V2.vcf\u0026quot;' V2 % vtools admin --rename_samples 'filename=\u0026quot;V3.vcf\u0026quot;' V3 INFO: 1 samples with names SAMP1 are renamed to V1 INFO: 1 samples with names SAMP1 are renamed to V2 INFO: 1 samples with names SAMP1 are renamed to V3  The samples now have different names:\n% vtools show samples sample_name filename V1 V1.vcf V2 V2.vcf V3 V3.vcf max_gt CASAVA18_SNP.txt  If you would like to change names of multiple samples according to a pattern, you can use the second form of the command. For example, the following command changes samples V1, V2, and V3 to SAMP1, SAMP2, and SAMP3:\n% vtools admin --rename_samples 1 V SAMP INFO: Rename 1 sample with name V1 to SAMP1 INFO: Rename 1 sample with name V2 to SAMP2 INFO: Rename 1 sample with name V3 to SAMP3 % vtools show samples sample_name filename SAMP1 V1.vcf SAMP2 V2.vcf SAMP3 V3.vcf max_gt CASAVA18_SNP.txt  The command might look strange to you, but the first 1 is a condition to select all samples (true), the second and third parameter changes the first incidence of V to SAMP for all matched sample names.\n\nIf you would like to prefix sample names by a string (e.g. V1 -\u0026gt; SAMP_V1), you can use commands such as vtools admin --rename_samples 1 '' SAMP_, because an empty string matches an empty string before the fist character of the sample name.\nMerge samples by sample\u0026rsquo;s name (--merge_samples) Command vtools admin --merge_samples merges samples with the same names to a single sample. This command is used when genotypes of a sample are stored in several files (e.g. chromosome by chromosome, or seprate files for SNPs and Indels resulting from the Illumina pipeline) and are imported as separate samples. These samples should be merged together because otherwise number of samples in the variant tools project will not match number of physical samples, and lead to erronous results during analysis. Because this command merge samples by names, samples to be merged should be renamed to have the same names if needed.\n Examples: Merge samples with same names All our samples have different names now so we have to rename one of them in order to merge it with another sample,\n% vtools admin --rename_samples 'sample_name = \u0026quot;max_gt\u0026quot;' SAMP3 INFO: 1 samples with names max_gt are renamed to SAMP3  Now we have four samples with the last two sharing the same name\n% vtools show genotypes sample_name filename num_genotypes sample_genotype_fields SAMP1 V1.vcf 989 GT SAMP2 V2.vcf 990 GT SAMP3 V3.vcf 988 GT SAMP3 CASAVA18_SNP.txt 21 GT,Q_max_gt  We can then merge the last two samples,\n% vtools admin --merge_samples INFO: 2 samples that share identical names will be merged to 1 samples Merging samples: 100% [=========================================] 2 235.8/s in 00:00:00  The genotypes are\n% vtools show genotypes sample_name filename num_genotypes sample_genotype_fields SAMP1 V1.vcf 989 GT SAMP2 V2.vcf 990 GT SAMP3 CASAVA18_SNP.txt,V3.vcf 1009 GT,Q_max_gt  Note the change of filename field of the last sample. In addition, the orignal SAMP3 sample does not have genotype info field Q_max_gt. The new SAMP3 has this field but the 988 genotypes from the orignal sample have NULL values for this field. \nSamples to be merged should not share any genotype (variant) because it is otherwise difficult to determine what genotypes to use for the merged sample.\n Examples: Fail to merge samples with shared genotypes If we rename sample SAMP2 to SAMP1,\n% vtools admin --rename_samples 1 SAMP2 SAMP1 INFO: Rename 1 sample with name SAMP2 to SAMP1  and try to merge SAMP2 to SAMP1, we will get an error message because SAMP1 and SAMP2 share many of the variants.\n% vtools admin --merge_samples INFO: 2 samples that share identical names will be merged to 1 samples Merging samples: 100% [=========================================] 2 197.5/s in 00:00:00 ERROR: Failed to merge samples with name SAMP1 because there are 1979 genotypes for 1341 unique variants.  Note that we use vtools admin --rename_samples 1 SAMP2 SAMP1 to rename sample using the second option of the vtools admin --rename_samples command. It is easier to use than vtools admin --rename_samples 'sample_name = \u0026quot;SAMP2\u0026quot;' SAMP1, but has the risk of renaming other tables containing SAMP2 (e.g. SAMP21) and should be used with caution. \nRename and modify descriptions of variant tables (--rename_table and --describe_table) A lot of variant tables can be generated during the analysis and it can be difficult to remember what types of variants are stored in each table. variant tools allows you to use arbitrary characters in table names and describe tables with messages when they are created, rename tables and modify their descriptions after they are created. The latter two operations are performed using commands vtools admin --rename-table OLDNAME NEWNAME and vtools admin --describe_table NAME NEW_DESCRIPTION. The usages of these two commands are straightforward.\n Examples: Change name and comment of variant tables Let us get a sample project and create a few variant tables\nvtools init testProj vtools admin --load_snapshot vt_simple vtools select variant -t 'all variant' vtools select variant --samples 'filename = \u0026quot;V1.vcf\u0026quot;' -t fromV1 'variants from v1'  The project has three tables,\n% vtools show tables table #variants date message all variant 1,611 Jul15 fromV1 989 Jul15 variants from v1 variant 1,611  You can rename the all variant to all_variant\n% vtools admin --rename_table 'all variant' all_variant INFO: Table all variant is renamed to all_variant  and give it a short description,\n% vtools admin --describe_table 'all_variant' 'A replicate of the master variant table' INFO: Description of table all_variant is updated  The table now has a new name and a description, but its creation date and command are not changed.\n% vtools show table all_variant Name: all_variant Description: A replicate of the master variant table Creation date: Jul15 Command: vtools select variant -t 'all variant' Fields: variant_id Number of variants: 1611  \nValidate build of project\u0026rsquo;s reference genome (--validate_build) Sometimes when you get a bunch of data, look everywhere in the folder and emails, and cannot find any information regarding the reference genome used to call the variants. In this case, you can import your data using the most likely build of reference genome (hg19), and use command vtools admin --validate_build to check if you have made the correct assumption.\n Examples: Validate the reference genome used in a project Let us create a project and get some test data\n% vtools init test % vtools admin --load_snapshot vt_testData Downloading snapshot vt_testData.tar.gz from online INFO: Snapshot vt_testData has been loaded  We would like to import data from V1.vcf, V2.vcf, and V3.vcf but do not know the correct reference genome to use, so we use hg19\n% vtools import V*.vcf --build hg19 INFO: Importing variants from V1.vcf (1/3) V1.vcf: 100% [======================================] 1,000 19.3K/s in 00:00:00 INFO: 989 new variants (989 SNVs) from 1,000 lines are imported. INFO: Importing variants from V2.vcf (2/3) V2.vcf: 100% [======================================] 1,000 27.6K/s in 00:00:00 INFO: 352 new variants (352 SNVs) from 995 lines are imported. INFO: Importing variants from V3.vcf (3/3) V3.vcf: 100% [======================================] 1,000 27.8K/s in 00:00:00 INFO: 270 new variants (270 SNVs) from 1,000 lines are imported. Importing genotypes: 100% [==========================] 2,995 1.5K/s in 00:00:02 Copying genotype: 100% [=================================] 3 8.1K/s in 00:00:00 INFO: 1,611 new variants (1,611 SNVs) from 2,995 lines (3 samples) are imported.  Let us see if these 1,611 variants have the correct reference alleles at the specified locations of the reference genome,\n% vtools admin --validate_build Validate reference alleles: 100% [=============] 1,611/1,238 14.8K/s in 00:00:00 INFO: 1611 non-insertion variants are checked. 1238 mismatch variants found.  As you can see, most of the variants do not have correct reference genomes. Now if we import the data using hg18, the validation process completes successfully and we are confident that we are using the correct reference genome this time.\n% vtools init test -f % vtools import V*.vcf --build hg18 % vtools admin --validate_build Validate reference alleles: 100% [==================] 1,611 60.1K/s in 00:00:00 INFO: 1611 non-insertion variants are checked. 0 mismatch variants found.  \nValidate sex of samples (--validate_sex) If your data contain genotypes on sex chromosomes and have sex information, you can use command vtools admin --validate_sex to check if the reported sex information match sample genotypes. To use this command, your project should have a phenotype with name sex or gender that contains sex of samples (coded in 1/2, M/F, or Male/Female, missing values are not allowed). This command goes through all samples, and identify inconsistencies by\n For males, check if there are homozygote alternative alleles on non-pseudo-autosomal regions of chromosome X, For females, check if there are any genotype on chromosome Y.  Variant calling pipelines are unlikely to call variants on sex chromosomes correctly if the variants are called blindly (without knowing chromosome name and sex of samples), so it is common that your data appear to have genotypes that are inconsistent with the sex of samples.\nSave and load snapshots of a project (--save_snapshot and --load_snapshot) You can save snapshots of the current project and revert to them later. This allows you to recover a project when it is damaged by incorrect operations or system failure, and more importantly, allows you to explore different processing pipelines with saved baseline stages. A snapshot is also a good way to carry a project around.\nThere are several types of snapshots:\n Online snapshots that can be downloaded automatically using command vtools admin --load_snapshot. The names of these snapshots starts with vt_. Project-specific snapshots that are saved in the project\u0026rsquo;s cache directory. These snapshots are saved and loaded by snapshot name and are listed by command vtools show snapshots. Local snapshots that are saved in arbitrarily specified directory, with extension .tar or .tar.gz (compressed). These snapshots are not listed by command vtools show snapshots.  You should in general use project-specific snapshots, unless you plan to carry the snapshots around. In that case you should use the compressed snapshots although it can take some time to compress a large project.\nAll changes to the current project will be lost if you revert to a previous snapshot.\n Examples: Save snapshots of a project  By default, a snapshot can be created with a name, and saved without compression in the cache directory of the current project:\n% vtools admin --save_snapshot stage1 \u0026quot;after importing date\u0026quot; INFO: Snapshot stage1 has been saved  A message is required to describe each snapshot so that you can know later on what this snapshot is about:\n% vtools show snapshots stage1 after importing date (122.0KB, created: Jul15 14:35:14) vt_qc snapshot for QC tutorial, exome data of 1000 genomes project with simulated GD and GQ scores (2.0GB, online snapshot) vt_ExomeAssociation Data with ~26k variants from chr1 and 2, ~3k samples, 3 phenotypes, ready for association testing. (446.0MB, online snapshot) vt_quickStartGuide A simple project with variants from the CEU and JPT pilot data of the 1000 genome project (148.0KB, online snapshot) vt_illuminaTestData Test data with 1M paired reads (49.0MB, online snapshot) vt_simple A simple project with variants imported from three vcf files (41.0KB, online snapshot) vt_testData An empty project with some test datasets (63.0KB, online snapshot)  If for some reason you would like to revert to a particular snapshot, you can do\n% vtools admin --load_snapshot stage1 INFO: Snapshot stage1 has been loaded  If the disk that holds your project does not have enough free diskspace to hold these snapshots, you can save snapshots to another disk using filenames with extension .tar, .tgz, or .tar.gz. In the latter two cases, the snapshot will be compressed.\n% vtools admin --save_snapshot stage1.tgz \u0026quot;after importing phenotypes\u0026quot; INFO: Snapshot stage1.tgz has been saved  This snapshot will not be displayed by command vtools show snapshots because it is managed by the current project\n% vtools show snapshots -l 2 stage1 after importing date (122.0KB, created: Jul15 14:35:14) vt_qc snapshot for QC tutorial, exome data of 1000 genomes project with simulated GD and GQ scores (2.0GB, online snapshot)  but it can be viewed using command vtools show snapshot\n% vtools show snapshot stage1.tgz Name: stage1.tgz Source: local Size: 40273 (40.0KB) Creation date: Jul15 14:36:37 Description: after importing phenotypes  You can revert to this snapshot using command\n% vtools admin --load_snapshot stage1.tgz INFO: Snapshot stage1.tgz has been loaded  A snapshot only contains the project, and the genotype database. It does not save log file, annotation databases, and various output and results (e.g. database created by command vtools associate. You should use --extra_files option to include other files in a snapshot.\n% vtools admin --save_snapshot stage1.tgz 'a snapshot with extra files' \\ --extra_files test.log cache/*  Directories cannot be directly added to snapshots, since recursively adding files under a directory may lead to unwanted behaviors (e.g., when symbolic links are involved). However you may use wildcard names (cache/*) to include files in a directory.\n\nSet and reset runtime options (--set_runtime_option and --reset_runtime_option) Setting runtime options, for example,\n% vtools admin --set_runtime_option 'logfile_verbosity=0'  can stop the project from writing debug information to a file.\nA list of runtime options and their descriptions could be obtained by\n% vtools show runtime_options associate_num_of_readers None (default) Use specified number of processes to read genotype data for association tests. The default value is the minimum of value of option --jobs and 8. Note that a large number of reading processes might lead to degraded performance or errors due to disk access limits. association_timeout None (default) Cancel associate test and return special values when a test lasts more than specified time (in seconds). The default value of this option is None, which stands for no time limit. check_update True (default) Automatically check update of variant tools and resources. import_num_of_readers 2 (default) variant tools by default uses two processes to read from input files during multi-process importing (--jobs \u0026gt; 0). You can want to set it to zero if a single process provides better performance or reduces disk traffic. local_resource ~/.variant_tools (default) A directory to store variant tools related resources such as reference genomes and annotation database. Files under this directory is usually downloaded automatically upon use, but can also be synchronized directly from http://vtools.houstonbioinformatics.org/. logfile_verbosity 2 (default) Verbosity level of the log file, can be 0 for warning and error only, 1 for general information, or 2 for general and debug information. search_path .;http://vtools.houstonbioinformatics.org/ (default) A ;-separated list of directories and URLs that are used to locate annotation database (.ann, .DB), file format (.fmt) and other files. Reset this option allows alternative local or online storage of such files. variant tools will append trailing directories such as annoDB for certain types of data so only root directories should be listed in this search path. sqlite_pragma (default) pragmas for sqlite database that can be used to optimize the performance of database operations. temp_dir None (default) Use the specified temporary directory to store temporary files to improve performance (use separate disks for project and temp files), or avoid problems due to insufficient disk space. treat_missing_as_wildtype False (default) Treat missing values as wildtype alleles for association tests. This option is used when samples are called individuals or in batch so genotypes for some samples are ignored and treated as missing if they consist of all wildtype alleles. This option should be used with caution because it convert real missing genotypes and genotypes removed due to, for example low quality score, to wildtype genotypes. verbosity 1 (default) Default verbosity level (to the standard output) of the project. This option can be set during vtools init where the verbosity level set by option --verbosity will be set as the project default.  In particular,\n temp_dir: Project temporary directory. By default a random temporary directory will be created each time when a project is opened. If  the partition that hosts the temporary directory is not large enough, the partition is slow, or if you would like to move the temporary directory to a separate physical disk to improve I/O performance,   you can set a different location for this directory. Note that this directory will be removed after the project is closed.\n sqlite_pragma: Sqlite pragma can have a significant impact on the performance of sqlite database operations. Variant tools strives to provide optimal pragma to achieve good performance (for example, synchronous=OFF to disable disk write check), but you can define your own set of pragmas that fit your environment. For example, if your system has plenty of RAM, you can use\n% vtools admin \u0026ndash;set_runtime_option \u0026lsquo;sqlite_pragma=synchronous=OFF,journal_mode=MEMORY\u0026rsquo;\n  to use in-memory journal.\nThe MEMORY journaling mode saves disk I/O but at the expense of database safety and integrity. If the application using SQLite crashes in the middle of a transaction when the MEMORY journaling mode is set, then the database file will very likely go corrupt []1.* You can enable it for data import operations such as vtools import and vtools update --from_file and set it to default (journal_mode=DELETE) afterwards.\nThe pragmas are usually applied to all databases (e.g. project, genotype and annotation databases) but you can limit the pragma to certain databases if you prefix it with database name (e.g. _geno.snchronous=OFF). This, however, needs an understanding of the databases involved in a command, and is generally not recommended. Please read about supported pragma statements here.\n treat_missing_as_wildtype: If your sample variants are called sample by sample or in batch, some variants might exists for certain samples but not for others, because they have all wildtype alleles for some samples and are not recorded. For example, if you are analyzing your samples with affected individuals, and use the 1000 genomes data as controls, novel variants in your data might not have corresponding genotypes in the 1000 genomes data, leading to complete missing genotypes for controls. The variants will likely to be discarded due to excessive missing data and will not be selected.  In this case, it is advised that you set runtime option treat_missing_as_wildtype to 1 before association analysis so that all missing and not-imported gentoypes are considered as wildtype alleles. This is dangerous because it might introduce a large number of non-existing (wildtype) alleles, and effectively change all NA genotypes to wildtype alleles from your input data. The results from such analysis should therefore be compared with results with this optoin turned off, and be examined closely for validity. If you would like to reset a runtime option, simply run\n% vtools admin --reset_runtime_option sqlite_pragma  to reset an option to its default values.\nConvert fasta files of non-human reference genomes to .crr files Variant tools supports human reference genomes natively. It can also work with other reference genomes in .crr format, which is a binary format that allows efficient random access to the reference genome. If you have a reference genome in fasta format, you will need to convert it to .crr format using command vtools admin --fasta2crr.\n Examples: Create a .crr file for a mouse genome\n% vtools admin --fasta2crr \\ ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm10/chromosomes/chr1.fa.gz \\ ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm10/chromosomes/chr2.fa.gz \\ ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm10/chromosomes/chr3.fa.gz \\ ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm10/chromosomes/chr4.fa.gz \\ ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm10/chromosomes/chr5.fa.gz \\ ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm10/chromosomes/chr6.fa.gz \\ ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm10/chromosomes/chr7.fa.gz \\ ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm10/chromosomes/chr8.fa.gz \\ ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm10/chromosomes/chr9.fa.gz \\ ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm10/chromosomes/chr10.fa.gz \\ ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm10/chromosomes/chr11.fa.gz \\ ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm10/chromosomes/chr12.fa.gz \\ ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm10/chromosomes/chr13.fa.gz \\ ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm10/chromosomes/chr14.fa.gz \\ ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm10/chromosomes/chr15.fa.gz \\ ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm10/chromosomes/chr16.fa.gz \\ ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm10/chromosomes/chr17.fa.gz \\ ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm10/chromosomes/chr18.fa.gz \\ ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm10/chromosomes/chr19.fa.gz \\ ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm10/chromosomes/chrX.fa.gz \\ ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm10/chromosomes/chrY.fa.gz \\ ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm10/chromosomes/chrM.fa.gz \\ mm10.crr  (:exampleend\n"

The integrative design of variant tools If you have used other sequencing or association analysis tools such as bedtools and pseq, you will be surprised that variant tools usually does not give you a nice report with a list of variants or genes with some useful information after performing an analysis. Instead, all the information, including results of analysis, are saved in the project in a consistent manner. An extra step is needed to output the information you need. In other words, the management and presentation of information regarding variants are two different processes, and you typically add more and more information to your project during analysis of your data. The end result is that you have immediate access to a large amount of information for the variants you are interested in, which can in turn help you perform more in-depth analysis. Using a fabricated and unusually long command,\n% vtools output # 2 myvariants # 1 chr pos ref alt # 3 hom_case hom_ctrl # 4 dbNSFP.SIFT_score dbSNP.name refGene.name2 # 5 asso1.p_value asso2.p_value # 6 \u0026quot;ref_sequence(chr, pos - 5, pos + 5)\u0026quot; # 7 \u0026quot;track('LP056A.BAM')\u0026quot; # 8 \u0026quot;genotype('WGS1')\u0026quot; # 9 \u0026quot;samples()\u0026quot;   myvariants contains a list of variants, which is a subset of the master variant table (all the variant of your project) and is typically created using command vtools select. Command vtools output output information for all variants in myvariant, which include chr, pos, ref, alt constitute a variant, namely location and type of a mutation. hom_case and hom_ctrl are number of homozygous genotypes of this variant in cases and controls. These are called variant info fields and are added to the project using command vtools update --from_stat dbNSFP.SIFT_score, dbSNP.name and refGene.name2 are annotation information from different annotation databases. Annotation databases are not part of the project. They are connected to the project using command vtools use. asso1.p_value and asso2.p_value are results of two different association analysis. These are annotation databases created by command vtools associate. ref_sequence (chr, pos-5, pos+5)` is a function provided by variant tools to retrieve the reference sequence around the variant. Here 5 basepair of the up and downstream of each variant is returned. track is a function to extract information from external files. In this example, the depth of coverage at the location of the variant in the specified bam file is returned. genotype(WGS1) is another function to get the genotype of this variant in sample WGS1, for example, 1 for heterozygote and 2 for homozygote. Function samples() lists the samples that contain the variant. As you can see, individual commands such as vtools use and vtools update do not produce any output, but adds information to the project that can be displayed along with others. Then, it is important to remember that all such information can be used to select, prioritize, and analyze your variants. Another fabricated command would look like  % vtools select # 1 myvariants # 2 \u0026quot;refGene.name2='BRCA1'\u0026quot; # 3 'dbNSFP.SIFT_score \u0026gt; 0.95' 'hom_case \u0026gt; 15' 'hom_ctrl = 0' # 4 'asso1.p_value \u0026lt; 0.05 OR asso2.p_value \u0026lt; 0.05' # 5 --to_table significant # 6   Command vtools select selects variants according to their properties It starts from table myvariants, which was itself selected using some other crieteria, The variants must be in gene BRCA1 and must have \u0026gt; 0.95 SIFT scores (probably damagin) it should appear in at least 15 of the cases as homozygote, and not available (as homozygote) in any of the controls and it should be significant in one of the association tests, the selected variant are written to another table names significant.  In summary,** variant tools is NOT designed to be a black-box tool that analyzes your data and generates a nice-looking report with a list of candidate variants or genes. It is a platform under which you can analyze your data using several methods, compare and analyze results, re-compare and re-analyze, and again using different methods or annotation sources, based on the information abtained from your previous analyses.** The unique advantage of variant tools is that you generally do not need to write a bunch of scripts to connect input output of different tools and parse and compare results in different formats, and you have easy access to a huge amount of information that help you select, prioritize and analyze your variants, all from your command line. However, because of the uniqueness of this design, please read through the Concepts section of this website before using variant tools.\n\nThings you can do with variant tools    Catagory Tasks     Variant calling Call variants from raw reads in FASTQ or BAM (convert to FASTQ first) formats using the GATK best practice pipeline.

	"content": " Import data Some of my samples occur in multiple vcf files but their genotype calls may be different. How can I identify them after they are imported? Because a file might contain genotype for multiple samples (.vcf), and genotype for a sample can be spread into several files (your case), a sample in variant tools is uniquely identified by filename and sample_name in the output of \u0026ldquo;vtools show sample\u0026rdquo;. However\n Samples usually come with pre-specified names (the header line of vcf or other text files). But you may customize sample names by option --sample_name in vtools import for different data sources when you import data. The customized names will overwrite the original names. Then your sample can be identified by option --samples 'sample_name = \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;' in vtools select command.\n If there are too many to customize, you could still identify your sample by filename + sample_name (e.g. --samples 'filename like \u0026quot;FILE_1%\u0026quot;' 'sample_name = \u0026quot;NA07000\u0026quot;').\n You can also add a column of customized sample names to the sample table using command vtools phenotype. You can then refer to the samples using the new names. For example you append an additional column sampleID to the sample table, where you customize sample names from different sources, then use --samples 'sampleID=\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;' to identify samples.\n  My filtering commands are running slowly With SQLite and MySQL, you can \u0026ldquo;analyze\u0026rdquo; tables or create indexes on table columns to help speed up queries. Creating indexes though does increase the size of the database and can slow down import speeds. Indexes based on genomic positions are automatically created by vtools.\nCan I rename sample\u0026rsquo;s name Is there a way to merge a sample from the different sources How to update the sample information, inclusing geno, and phenotype information What kind formats can be imported using vtools What kind of formats of the results can be outputed using vtools Can I use the different versions of human genome assembled How to create sub-project Can I exclude some specific samples How to remove the tables I created how to create connection between my samples and the annotation database Can I use more than 1 annotation databases vtools execute 'analyze variant'\nvtools execute 'create index my_index on variant(some_field)'\nFor more help see:\n http://www.sqlite.org/lang_analyze.html http://www.sqlite.org/lang_createindex.html  "
