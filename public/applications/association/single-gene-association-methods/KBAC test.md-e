# Kernel Based Adaptive Clustering Method 



## Introduction

This is implementation for the KBAC statistic in Liu and Leal 2010[^Dajiang J. Liu and Suzanne M. Leal (2010) **A Novel Adaptive Method for the Analysis of Next-Generation Sequencing Data to Detect Complex Trait Associations with Rare Variants Due to Gene Main Effects and Interactions**. *PLoS Genetics* doi:`10.1371/journal.pgen.1001156`. <http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1001156>^]. It carries out case-control association testing for rare variants for whole exome association studies. Briefly, consider a gene of length n which harbors m rare variants. Genotype on the m variant sites & the disease status (case/control) are known for each individual. The program takes as input the m-site genotype and disease status (case/control) data files, and computes a p-value indicating the significance of association. Permutation has to be used to obtain valid p-values. 

[An R package][1] is also available for use with standalone text dataset. 

Note a couple of differences between this implementation and the original version: 



*   The original paper provides 3 kernel options: hypergeometric, binomial and Gaussian kernels. The hypergeometric kernel generally performs best and is implemented. Other kernels are not implemented. 
*   The `--alternative 2` option implements the spirit of the RBT test[^Iuliana Ionita-Laza, Joseph D. Buxbaum, Nan M. Laird and Christoph Lange (2011) **A New Testing Strategy to Identify Rare Variants with Either Risk or Protective Effect on Disease**. *PLoS Genetics* doi:`10.1371/journal.pgen.1001289`. <http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1001289>^] by performing two KBAC tests under both *protective* and *deleterious* assumptions and use the larger of the two statistics thus calculated as the final KBAC statistic.

    Name:          KBAC
    Description:   Kernel Based Adaptive Clustering method, Liu & Leal 2010
    usage: vtools associate --method KBAC [-h] [--name NAME] [-q1 MAFUPPER]
                                          [-q2 MAFLOWER] [--alternative TAILED]
                                          [-p N] [--adaptive C]
                                          [--moi {additive,dominant,recessive}]
    
    Kernel Based Adaptive Clustering method, Liu & Leal 2010. Genotype pattern
    frequencies, weighted by a hypergeometric density kernel function, is compared
    for differences between cases and controls. p-value is calculated using
    permutation for consistent estimate with different sample sizes (the
    approximation method of the original publication is not implemented). Two-
    sided KBAC test is implemented by calculating a second statistic with
    case/ctrl label swapped, and the larger of the two statistic is used as two-
    sided test statistic
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --name NAME           Name of the test that will be appended to names of
                            output fields, usually used to differentiate output of
                            different tests, or the same test with different
                            parameters.
      -q1 MAFUPPER, --mafupper MAFUPPER
                            Minor allele frequency upper limit. All variants
                            having sample MAF<=m1 will be included in analysis.
                            Default set to 0.01
      -q2 MAFLOWER, --maflower MAFLOWER
                            Minor allele frequency lower limit. All variants
                            having sample MAF>m2 will be included in analysis.
                            Default set to 0.0
      --alternative TAILED  Alternative hypothesis is one-sided ("1") or two-sided
                            ("2"). Default set to 1
      -p N, --permutations N
                            Number of permutations
      --adaptive C          Adaptive permutation using Edwin Wilson 95 percent
                            confidence interval for binomial distribution. The
                            program will compute a p-value every 1000 permutations
                            and compare the lower bound of the 95 percent CI of
                            p-value against "C", and quit permutations with the
                            p-value if it is larger than "C". It is recommended to
                            specify a "C" that is slightly larger than the
                            significance level for the study. To disable the
                            adaptive procedure, set C=1. Default is C=0.1
      --moi {additive,dominant,recessive}
                            Mode of inheritance. Will code genotypes as 0/1/2/NA
                            for additive mode, 0/1/NA for dominant or recessive
                            model. Default set to additive
